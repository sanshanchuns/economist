EVERY NOVEMBER we publish our annual predictive guide to the coming year, The World Ahead. In this year’s edition, our correspondents and invited experts consider the uncertain global outlook in geopolitics, economics, technology and culture; analyse how Donald Trump’s reshaping of global norms means problems for Europe and opportunities for China; and look forward to space missions, video games and improved weight-loss drugs.
