FRANCE IS THE land of haute cuisine and haute couture. Of elegance and aesthetics. Of sophistication and sex appeal. This stereotype extends to business. The largest French companies, LVMH and Hermès, are purveyors of luxury to the global elites. Yet as the country enters another political crisis following the collapse on September 8th of the second government in less than a year, it is a rather duller side of France SA that is outshining the rest. The latest crisis was precipitated by the minority government’s effort to start plugging a widening fiscal hole. This is necessary—and in keeping with the pro-market instincts of the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron. It is also predictably unpopular. A nascent social-media movement wants to “block

everything”. Protests erupted on September 10th. The sole, unhappy concession to stability is French GDP, which despite Mr Macron’s reformist efforts has not moved much since he was re-elected in 2022.

Bond markets are on edge. So are other investors. Venture capitalists have just had their quietest French quarter in more than five years, according to PitchBook, a data provider. Buy-out barbarians spy few gates worth storming. France’s CAC 40 is dead-last among the rich world’s blue-chip indices over the past year. It has risen by 4%, barely more than a third as much as Britain’s FTSE 100 and America’s Dow Jones Industrial Average, the other two stragglers. Japanese stocks have jumped by a fifth, Canadian ones by a quarter and Hong Kong’s by half. German, Italian and Spanish share prices are up by a third or so.

The resulting existential dread enveloping many French boardrooms would make Jean-Paul Sartre seem chirpy. Even LVMH and Hermès are looking tattered. Frayed by Donald Trump’s trade war and the Chinese bling-buyers’ increasingly Sartrean gloom, they have shed nearly €200bn ($235bn) in value since mid-February, equivalent to 30% of their combined market capitalisation. If this formidable duo are suffering malaise, having long been the main exception to it among French businesses, what hope is there for anyone else?

A fair bit, in fact—so long as you avert your gaze from high fashion, high tech, high finance and other glamorous industries du jour. Look instead at the unsexy, and France has lots to offer.

The first unsexy French exception can be found among perennial corporate disappointments. Examples include Danone, France’s yogurt champion; Orange, its biggest telecoms operator; and Société Générale, its fourth- largest bank by assets. By January this year anyone who had bought shares in any of them at the start of 2020 saw virtually no net returns (and that is including dividends). Since then all three have been some of the best- performing large firms globally in their respective sectors. Their share prices have shot up by 15%, 40% and 100%, respectively.

Danone is finally skimming the cream from its decision a couple of years ago to ditch its obsession with stakeholder value and focus on shareholders.

Société Générale, too, is cashing in on a two-year-old turnaround plan, which has involved deep cost cuts, sales of non-core units and a refocus on domestic retail banking. JPMorgan Chase, a bank, expects a “break-out year” for Orange, as it reins in capital spending on network expansion and takes advantage of European regulators’ new-found tolerance for consolidation to snap up a rival or two.

The second source of solace comes from France’s smaller publicly traded firms, which lack the cachet of the CAC 40. Being more exposed than multinationals to the European economy, they have suffered disproportionately from its prolonged sluggishness. But this also makes them less vulnerable to global disruption brought about by Mr Trump’s witless trade policy and the protectionist responses it is eliciting from other countries.

So far this year the MSCI index of France’s listed minnows has climbed by 15%, three times as much as the CAC 40 and not far off Germany’s DAX, the rich world’s second-hottest major index of 2025 behind the sizzling Hang Seng. The small French fry have also outshone their American opposite numbers in the Russell 2000, susceptible to Mr Trump’s erratic economic policymaking. They have even got one over on the NASDAQ, full of frothy artificial-intelligence (AI) stocks.

A third group of French winners are the least chic of all. Since 2019 the operating profits of Engie and Veolia, two boring utilities, have more than doubled, growing at twice the compound annual rate of a typical global rival. Their return on capital is higher, too. The net profit of Saint-Gobain, which churns out building materials, leaves most peers in the dust. Vinci boasts the highest operating margin among the West’s big builders (and with a market capitalisation of $73bn is far and away the most valuable). Since 2019 Schneider Electric and Legrand have outgrown most rival makers of electrical components in terms of sales.

If the luxury sector is the product of France’s sharp dress sense, these dull businesses are testament to the country’s knack for producing sharp engineers, remarks Gerry Fowler of UBS, a bank. Like Société Générale, Orange and the minnows, they are benefiting from lower reliance on global

markets. Europe’s embrace of decarbonisation, with its attendant infrastructure needs, provides a helpful tailwind.

France has some game left in glamorous sectors. Mistral, a Parisian startup, is the most coveted AI model-builder outside America and China; it has just secured a €1.3bn investment from ASML, a Dutch chip-industry star. Franco-German Airbus flies rings round Boeing. French admen are the world’s canniest. LVMH and Hermès remain peerless in luxury, recent stumbles notwithstanding. But elsewhere in French business, dull is the new black. ■
