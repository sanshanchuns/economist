Quietly, in a jargon-filled statement on the Argentine central bank’s website, President Javier Milei has made a crucial change. From January the Argentine peso—bloodied by markets and propped up by Donald Trump last year—will be allowed to float more freely. Since April it has moved within a band, the limits of which widen by 1% each month. Now they will widen with inflation, currently 2.5% per month. That will allow the peso, which many believe is overvalued, to weaken more rapidly. It will also help with a new plan to buy some $10bn in foreign reserves next year. All this is a welcome, if cautious, step to address the biggest weakness in Mr Milei’s liberalising reform programme.

His government has long sought to keep the peso strong. This has helped to pull inflation down but weighed on exports and made foreign-reserve accumulation very hard. That has worried the IMF and investors, who are owed dollars. As midterm elections approached in October, everyone began selling pesos, forcing the central bank to sell billions of dollars to defend the band’s limit. The peso was in danger of crashing out, potentially tanking Mr Milei’s electoral prospects and wider reform project. Then, extraordinarily, the US Treasury backed the peso. That relieved pressure and helped Mr Milei to win. He still insisted that he would not alter the exchange-rate regime, but investors remained concerned.

The IMF immediately welcomed the latest shift. So did markets: Argentine stocks and dollar-denominated bonds jumped, suggesting that the government could soon borrow in global capital markets again. The peso weakened. Widening the bands risks a modest rise in inflation, but that is less of a problem for the government with midterms out of the way.

Still, this is far from a full float. In real terms the band was in effect forcing the peso to strengthen over time. It will now allow it to weaken, but only marginally. This will still leave the peso overvalued, says Capital Economics, a consultancy in London. Moreover, the central bank says foreign-reserve purchases will be contingent on the rate of economic growth and the size of the foreign-exchange market. It has still not announced a programme to target inflation through interest rates. Mr Milei’s monetary journey is not yet over. ■
