From today’s salacious perspective, Christopher Marlowe got everything right. Astoundingly, the shoemaker’s son made it to Cambridge and was soon a trailblazing playwright. He wrote boldly about same-sex desire and, though free-thinking could be fatal in Elizabethan England, was said to be a vocal atheist. His mysterious life seems to have encompassed a side-hustle as a spy. Mysterious and—like the lives of many rebels, Romantics and rock stars— short. In 1593, when he was 29, Marlowe was stabbed in the eye in a shady brawl. The killer was pardoned; speculation about the mastermind has since roped in Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I.

Daring, scandal and tragedy are a good formula for immortality. Yet Marlowe is little known and less performed. In “Dark Renaissance”, an evocative new biography, Stephen Greenblatt of Harvard aims to resurrect him. He is not alone. The Guardian recently urged readers to “restore Marlowe to his rightful place”. Set in the early 1590s when he was already a hitmaker, “Born with Teeth” (pictured), a rollicking play on in the West End, has him trying to seduce a novice dramatist, William Shakespeare, and recruit him as a spook.

“You’ll never be anything but a minor talent,” the stage Marlowe tells the rival whose glory would blot out his own. The overlap between them helps make Marlowe a test case for the discernment of posterity and the justice of reputation. Are his boosters right?

His was an age of paranoia and spectacular violence; of real and imaginary plots, betrayals and double agents. A lot of people were hanged, drawn and quartered. Men like him needed mighty patrons (but could be crushed if they fell). Evidently Marlowe found them while at Cambridge: a cabal of potentates strongarmed his college into awarding him an Ma, since “He had done her Majesty good service…in matters touching the benefit of his country.” Bigwigs seem to have vouched for him again when he was busted in a counterfeiting scam.

Scholarly yet buccaneering, clandestine but reckless—Marlowe the man is contradictory and sketchy. His plays are his real testament, above all “Doctor Faustus”, who barters his soul to Lucifer. Marlowe’s lurid plots were a sensation, as were his themes of power and sex. He made blank verse a go-to medium of English drama, the rhythm pulsing through the lines like a heartbeat. He pioneered the history play and the soliloquy, which laid thoughts and feelings bare. Professor Greenblatt credits him with “the invention of inwardness”.

That makes his neglect seem as harsh as his unavenged killing. Until you consider what came after him—ie, Shakespeare. Marlowe wrote some limpid lines, as when a devil explains hell’s whereabouts to Faustus: “Why this is hell, nor am I out of it.” He also wrote a lot of bombast and magniloquence. Shakespeare could match that and be breathtakingly poignant. Shylock’s piercing monologue in “The Merchant of Venice”—“If

you prick us, do we not bleed?”—outclasses anything in “The Jew of Malta”, the Marlowe play that preceded it.

Marlowe’s vaunting anti-heroes seem to strain against the marionette’s strings, struggling free of the hoary archetypes of yore. From cameos to protagonists, Shakespeare’s characters live and breathe. (“I was aiming at actual human beings,” he says of his creations in “Born with Teeth”.) Only around a decade separated “Doctor Faustus” from “Hamlet”, but in psychological nuance and acuity the gap feels wider.

It is Marlowe’s misfortune to be bracketed always with the finest writer in English. Still, his relative obscurity holds lessons for what lasts and what doesn’t, and what makes an artist’s name. One is that being best matters much more than being first. Marlowe was England’s first great playwright, but that has counted for little when the next was so much greater. And in art, as in commerce, second-best can be an empty accolade. The laurels available to Elizabethan dramatists have all gone to Shakespeare.

If that seems unfair, the last lesson is reassuring. In “Born with Teeth”, Marlowe calls Shakespeare an “obedient schoolboy”, and his life was indeed tame and bourgeois by comparison. He married early, went into business and bought property; no state secrets, no vicious scraps. It hasn’t mattered. Nor, ultimately, has Marlowe’s flamboyant career and untimely demise. Instead they have been judged on their output and talent. Marlowe’s is a bloodcurdling story, but in the long run, he has got what he deserved. ■
