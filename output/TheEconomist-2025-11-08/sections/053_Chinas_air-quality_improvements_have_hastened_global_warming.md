CHINA STILL burns a hell of a lot of coal. But since the “air-pocalypse” of 2013 it has worked on doing so in a much less brimstone-y way. A large proportion of the tiny particles that make up air pollution in cities are sulphates which can be traced back to the sulphur found in coal and fuel oils. When China decided to clean up its filthy air, sulphur was one of the things it sought to suppress. Use of sulphurous fuels was reduced; chemical devices were installed to remove sulphur from the flue gases pumped out by power stations. These steps, along with others, greatly improved air quality in Chinese cities. Its citizens’ lungs are much the better for it, and their lives the longer.

They are also a little hotter; and so, on average, is everyone else. Sulphate aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, cooling the surface below; they can also thicken clouds, providing a similar effect. Reducing the amount of sulphur going up into the sky by 20m tonnes a year, as China has, means fewer aerosols and less of those cooling effects.

Scientists believe that the acceleration in global warming seen since the mid- 2010s has been largely due to changes in the abundance of aerosols and the properties of clouds. The biggest factor in this has been lower sulphur emissions as East and South-East Asian economies have cleaned up their emissions, and China is the biggest player there by far.

As and when China moves from cleaner coal to less coal, a further warming can be expected. This is not an argument for keeping coal. For one thing, sulphates still kill people. Getting them under control in China has saved hundreds of thousands of lives; more reductions will do more good. For another, the warming effects of carbon dioxide are far more long lasting than the cooling effects of sulphur. A power plant’s sulphates last only as long as the power plant; aerosols fall out of the lower atmosphere in weeks. Much of the same plant’s carbon dioxide will hang around for centuries, warming all the while.

Paul Crutzen, a Nobel-prize-winning atmospheric chemist, saw this problem coming, and in 2006 suggested a way out. A comparatively small amount of sulphur injected high into the stratosphere can provide as much cooling as lots of sulphur in the lower atmosphere, and with far less harm to human life.

Both the possibilities of such geoengineering and its drawbacks are now being discussed more widely and seriously than ever before. Considering the size of China’s research capacity, says an American expert who served under Joe Biden, the level of geoengineering research there is no more than modest. “But interest appears to be increasing, and could be rapidly accelerated.” ■
