In a general election on August 17th Rodrigo Paz (pictured), a centrist  
senator, chalked up a shock win with 32% of votes; polling had predicted  
closer to 10%. He will run off against Jorge Quiroga, a right-wing former  
president who led his coalition to second place, on October 19th. And in  
third place? Spoiled ballots. Evo Morales, a former president who was  
forced out of the left-wing Movement to Socialism (MAS) and barred from  
running by a court ruling, had called for a “null vote” in protest. People  
listened. Eduardo del Castillo, the permitted MAS candidate, won just 3%—  
barely enough to maintain the party’s legal status. That marks the end of  
nearly 20 years of MAS rule, and assures a rightward tilt for the country’s  
politics in October. ■
