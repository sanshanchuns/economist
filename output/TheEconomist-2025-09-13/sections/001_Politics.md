Poland shot down Russian drones that had entered its air space, the most far- reaching intrusion ever into NATO territory. The Netherlands assisted Poland. Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, said the incursion brought NATO closer to “open conflict” with Russia. Poland had earlier decided to close its border with Belarus while Russia conducts its Zapad war games there, which simulate an attack on NATO. Analysts think the previous Zapad manoeuvres in 2021 were a training ground for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr Tusk said a Belarusian spy had been arrested and a diplomat would be expelled. At least 24 pensioners queuing to collect their benefits were killed by a Russian air strike on a village in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Russia has carried out its largest attack across Ukraine since the start of the war, hitting

the north, south and east of the country with a blitz of drones and missiles and setting the government’s main building in Kyiv on fire.

Emmanuel Macron appointed Sébastien Lecornu as the next prime minister of France, after François Bayrou lost a vote of confidence in the National Assembly over his plans to cut spending. Mr Lecornu, previously the armed- forces minister, is Mr Macron’s seventh prime minister since 2017. Adding to the upheaval, “Block Everything” protests broke out across France. Markets are unimpressed. The government’s borrowing costs on ten-year bonds continue to hold above those of Greece, as investors bet that Mr Lecornu will also struggle to get a grip on France’s fiscal crisis.

Sir Keir Starmer, Britain’s prime minister, found himself on the back foot again about his political judgment. He was forced to sack Peter Mandelson as Britain’s ambassador to America after more revelations emerged about a past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a deceased sex offender. The opposition Conservatives had raised questions about why Lord Mandelson was appointed in the first place. A few days earlier Angela Rayner resigned as deputy leader of the Labour Party for underpaying tax on a new home—she had been in charge of the government’s housing policy.

Norway’s Labour Party won another term in office in an election, at which the anti-immigration Progress Party doubled its number of seats in parliament and support for the centre-right collapsed. The prime minister, Jonas Gahr Store, will now rely on an alliance of smaller left, green and agrarian parties to pass key legislation.

Israel bombed a villa in the Qatari capital, Doha, where it said senior Hamas officials were meeting. Six people were killed but their identities remain unclear; Hamas insists none of its leaders was among them. Qatar, which hosts an American base and has been facilitating talks over a ceasefire in Gaza, said Israel’s attack was “state terrorism”. American officials denied they knew about the strike in advance. Donald Trump said that he felt “very badly” about the attack and that it did not assist Israel’s or America’s goals. Meanwhile, Israel carried out further strikes on the Houthis, an Iranian- backed militia in Yemen.

Israel ordered all residents of Gaza city, around a million people, to evacuate ahead of its anticipated ground offensive, Gideon’s Chariots II. Binyamin Netanyahu said recent air strikes on the area, which have killed scores of Palestinians, were only the beginning of the main “intensive operation” to capture what he says is Hamas’s last stronghold.

Palestinian gunmen killed six people at a bus stop in Jerusalem. The Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said it was responsible for the attack.

The UN atomic agency claimed to have reached a deal with Iran that would give it access to Iran’s main nuclear sites. Doing so might allow international inspectors to assess the damage done by American and Israeli air strikes in June and check Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium, according to the agency. Iran’s foreign minister said that it had not yet agreed to allow inspectors to visit the sites.

Jihadist terrorism continued to plague Africa. The Allied Democratic Forces, which is linked to Islamic State, killed at least 50 mourners during a vigil at a church in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. In Mali an al-Qaeda- linked group tried to block fuel from reaching Bamako, the capital; the military responded with air strikes. In Mozambique a wave of Islamist attacks in the Muidumbe district of Cabo Delgado province has displaced 1,319 people since August. Almost 100,000 have fled the violence so far this year.

Charlie Kirk, a conservative podcaster and activist in America, was shot dead at a college event in Utah. He was 31. Police hunted for the killer, a lone shooter. Utah’s governor called it a political assassination. Donald Trump, who has faced two assassination attempts himself, blamed the rhetoric of the radical left for comparing “wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers”.

America’s Supreme Court decided that immigration officers could continue their expansive raids in Los Angeles, lifting a lower court’s blocking of the operations because of concerns over racial profiling. Other litigation is pending, but one of the justices on the Supreme Court said that for now, the officers could use ethnicity as a “relevant factor” in whom they decide to question.

Ishiba Shigeru resigned as Japan’s prime minister. His position had become untenable following the loss of the upper house in an election in July. He was in the job for less than a year. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party will hold an election probably on October 4th to decide who Japan’s fifth prime minister in five years will be. The front-runners include Takaichi Sanae, hoping to become the country’s first female leader, and Koizumi Shinjiro, the son of a former prime minister.

At least 19 people were killed during anti-corruption protests in Nepal. K.P. Sharma Oli resigned as prime minister, but that did little to quell the violence. The palace that houses the prime minister’s office was set on fire and senior politicians were physically attacked. A curfew was imposed in Kathmandu, the capital.

Anutin Charnvirakul was elected as Thailand’s new prime minister by parliament following the dismissal of Paetongtarn Shinawatra by the Constitutional Court. Mr Anutin leads the Bhumjaithai party and must call an election within four months, according to the agreement with the opposition People’s Party that pushed him into power. Thaksin Shinawatra, father of the ousted Paetongtarn, was sentenced to a year in prison after the Supreme Court decided that his spell in a police hospital did not count towards his previous sentence for corruption.

In Argentina, Javier Milei’s Libertarian party was trounced in a legislative election in Buenos Aires province by the Peronist opposition, indicating that the president faces a tricky midterm congressional election on October 26th. Stockmarkets fell and the peso slumped, as investors fretted that Mr Milei’s tough-love reforms may be in jeopardy. Acknowledging the defeat, Mr Milei vowed to “accelerate” his programme of fiscal rectitude.

Forty-five soldiers who had been taken captive in Colombia were released without harm. It was the latest incident of troops involved in anti-drug operations being held by locals, often under pressure from dissident rebels who are involved in trafficking. In August 34 soldiers were snatched and also set free without incident.

The final results from an election in Jamaica showed that the Labour party had won another term, though the opposition People’s National Party doubled its seats in Parliament. Andrew Holness, who has been prime minister since 2016, campaigned on a platform of reducing taxes, increasing the minimum wage and reducing crime.
