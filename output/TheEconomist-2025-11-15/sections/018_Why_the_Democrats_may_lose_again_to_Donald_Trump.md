Besides being members of Congress from the Democratic Party, Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, California, and Jared Golden of Lewiston, Maine, have little in common. She favours Armani suits, he flannel shirts. Unlike him, she has never starred in a campaign advertisement cradling a rifle in elaborately tattooed arms, then cocking and firing it. She represents one of the country’s dense, urban, left-wing districts, where the median household income is more than twice that of Mr Golden’s constituents. His voters are spread through a vast region of pine forests and river towns where textile and paper mills have shut down, in a district Donald Trump won easily three times. After Mr Golden was first elected in 2018 he fulfilled a campaign

promise by voting against Ms Pelosi to become Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Yet close observers might have noticed that Mr Golden never suffered for that vote, or for others he took opposing Ms Pelosi’s leadership. In fact, he managed to get appointed to the congressional committees on which he most wanted to serve, the ones that would most benefit his constituents back home. When he needed help raising money for one of his most difficult campaigns, Ms Pelosi quietly tapped her network for him.

So it seemed somehow right that Ms Pelosi chose to announce she would not seek another term on November 6th, the day after Mr Golden said he would not run again. In making way for the next generation, Ms Pelosi is displaying a wisdom that has been lacking among leaders of both parties. She first ran for office back in 1987, after bringing up five children, and she is now 85.

By contrast, amid Democratic euphoria over electoral wins this month, Mr Golden’s choice is a warning to the party and about politics in general. At 43 he is younger than Ms Pelosi was when she first ran. A House where a politician like him feels he can no longer serve is not the same House whose factional intricacies she mastered. The question for Democrats, who will now probably lose Mr Golden’s seat in 2026, is whether their leaders are still sensible enough to cultivate such independent-minded centrists—politicians who, in the time of Trump, are the party’s real radicals.

Mr Golden was facing a primary from his left and then another tough general election. But he did not fear losing, he wrote in the Bangor Daily News, in explaining his decision not to run again. “What has become apparent to me”, he continued, “is that I now dread the prospect of winning.” Mr Golden, a Marine veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who usually carries a concealed handgun, has received many death threats over the years. After yet another one caused police to descend on his home last Thanksgiving, he and his family holed up for days at a hotel. Now that he has two young daughters at home, he wrote, he fears exposing them to such risks and to “the intolerance and hate” in his political life.

At the same time, the legislative body of which Mr Golden is a member has become a giant marble green room where aspiring celebrity-politicians build their brands by posting on X or Bluesky while awaiting their next hit on Fox or MSNBC. Mr Golden sees little prospect of accomplishing much, allies say, particularly given the direction of the Democrats. Their centrist “Blue Dog” caucus in the House is down to ten members, including him, from 54 in 2009. Just 13 Democrats hold seats in districts Mr Trump carried. As close as the popular vote was in the last three presidential elections, each time Mr Trump won the vast majority of America’s counties; in 2024 he swept 2,660, compared with 452 that went to the Democrat, Kamala Harris. This is a gauge of that party’s obstacles to winning thinly settled rural districts like Mr Golden’s, and majorities in the Senate and the Electoral College.

Mr Golden was the lone House Democrat to vote against the government shutdown. He argued—rightly, it turned out—that it would hurt Americans without accomplishing the Democrats’ stated goal of extending subsidies for health-insurance payments. He accused Democratic leaders of catering to “far-left groups” by pantomiming opposition to Mr Trump. Just as the Republican Party has been “hijacked” by the MAGA movement, Mr Golden wrote, Democrats are “going down the same path” and allowing “the most extreme, pugilistic elements of our party to call the shots”.

Mr Trump and some of his allies resist reaching moral judgments about fellow travellers on the right, even when they are toxic. When other leaders of the party criticised members of a “Young Republicans” group in New York last month for racism and antisemitism on a group chat, Vice-President J.D. Vance dismissed the objections as “pearl-clutching” and the slurs, by 20- and 30-somethings, as “what kids do”. Unlike other Republicans who expressed outrage, he has conspicuously failed to distance himself from an ally, Tucker Carlson, who conducted a friendly interview with Nick Fuentes, an admirer of Adolf Hitler.

Democrats have a different problem: they turn complex policy disputes into vicious moral ones. Mr Golden, his allies say, is sick of being condemned as beyond the pale by fellow Democrats over, say, his support for Israel or opposition to the shutdown, even though he supports not just extending

health-care subsidies but also abortion rights and many other Democratic priorities.

Ms Pelosi, who has had her own struggles with the party’s left, had little patience for a finicky morality that hobbled the pursuit of the majorities needed for programmes like the Affordable Care Act, probably her greatest legislative achievement. Never a master wordsmith, she would tell allies they needed to be “two-ventricled”, by which she meant cold-blooded. In the wake of Mr Golden’s decision, one Democratic insider in Maine laments, “the left-leaning Democrats are so wrapped up in their own world” that they have forgotten “you’ve got to frigging win”. ■
