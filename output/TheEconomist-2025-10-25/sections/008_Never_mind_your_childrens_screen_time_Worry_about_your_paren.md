Few things delight children, or irritate their minders, as much as screen time. Parents nag their offspring to put down their digital devices and pick up a book or a football. Academics such as Jonathan Haidt worry that phones and social media are creating an “anxious generation” of indoorsy introverts. Some countries are banning social media for under-16s. The worry may be focused on the wrong age group. For all the fears around teens and screens, the most square-eyed generation is the elderly. Older people have long been champion tv-viewers. Now a new generation of pensioners are adding to their screen time with smartphones, iPads and game

consoles. The result is epic screen sessions, which take up more than half of pensioners’ waking hours.

The digitisation of old age is a good thing. The elderly have perhaps more to gain from smart devices than any other age group. Facebook and WhatsApp bring daily updates from old friends and faraway grandchildren. Zoom transports church, book clubs and doctors’ appointments into the home for people who cannot attend in person. E-commerce removes the need to trek around shops. Hours of entertainment from any era are available on demand. A connected retirement is more fulfilling and fun than an offline one.

Older people are also insulated from some of the on-screen risks that threaten teenagers. They have already formed their key real-life relationships, and so are less in danger of the “social stunting” that screen- obsessed children supposedly suffer. Their worldview is less open to manipulation by online weirdos who encourage misogyny or body dysmorphia among young folk. Above all, the elderly usually have oodles of free time. For a teenager facing exams, the opportunity cost of a five-hour-a- day TikTok habit is high. For a pensioner it is a case of swapping one leisure pursuit for another. Parents and policymakers have a right to interfere with how children spend their time. Adults should be free to waste it as they like.

Yet as retirement moves online there will be costs that society must reckon with. Older folks’ devices, unlike those of teenagers, are usually connected to credit cards. Door-to-door conmen, who have long preyed on the elderly, can now go iPad-to-iPad. Governments rightly strive to protect children from online predators. They must recognise that there is another, fast- growing vulnerable group to look after.

A second cost is misinformation. Pensioners are twice as likely as under-25s to use news apps or websites. Older people also appear to be more susceptible than others to online hoaxes (which artificial intelligence promises to make still more convincing). As older generations shift from spending their time in front of Fox or the BBC to spending it on YouTube or TikTok, they are entering a Wild West of information. And when the elderly are misled it is everyone’s problem, because they are the most likely to vote.

Screen time has a mixed impact on loneliness. Screens are companions for the isolated. But they can also be a substitute for real life. E-commerce removes the hassle of the weekly shopping trip—but also the social interactions that come with it. Consumers are free to make such choices. But for the infirm, the siren song of the sofa is especially strong. Balancing the pros and cons of screen use is easier for teenagers, whose time online is curbed by teachers during the day and parents in the evening. Older folk lack these informal mediators.

Old people’s rocketing screen time should at least make for a more measured debate on digital matters. Generations do not always understand each other well. There is a long history of policymakers calling for bans on youth crazes, from rock ’n’ roll to violent video games. When the craze catches on more widely, the panic tends to die down. Universal use of smartphones and social media should make it easier to have sensible conversations about their trade-offs. And when children are told for the umpteenth time to get off their phones, they can cast a meaningful glance at grandpa in the corner, chuckling at the latest memes on WhatsApp. ■
