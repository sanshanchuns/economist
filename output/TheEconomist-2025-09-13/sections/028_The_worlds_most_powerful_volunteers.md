TO MARK THE centenary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Mohan Bhagwat, its leader, last month delivered a series of speeches. He recounted the long history of an organisation that claims to be the biggest volunteer group in the world. He defended its Hindu-first vision for India. By the standards of your average birthday party, the hours-long lectures were not fun. But for a movement that prizes discipline and obsesses about ideology, it seemed a fitting way to celebrate. The RSS insists that its more than 5m members—all male—are doing India good. They gather regularly in over 83,000 shakhas (branches) across the country to recite prayers, play games, perform martial drills and do charity. They aspire to make India a rigidly Hindu country—one in which minorities,

notably Muslims and Christians, should accept Hindu culture as pre- eminent. This philosophy, known as Hindutva, runs against India’s secular constitution but underpins the RSS and its large family of affiliated organisations. These include student clubs, charities and a giant trade union.

These days much of its power comes through its ties to politics. India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the RSS’s ideological offspring. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, is the group’s most famous alumnus. Mr Modi served as an RSS pracharak (worker) for many years before moving to the BJP. In a speech last month he celebrated the RSS’s vast size. His cabinet contains several RSS men. The group’s cadres sometimes act as campaign workers for the ruling party.

This outcome was difficult to imagine when the RSS formed in 1925. Its creator, a doctor-turned-activist named Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, talked of restoring India to greatness after centuries (as he saw it) of humiliation under Muslim and then British rule. Hedgewar created a paramilitary-style volunteer corps. Some of the organisation’s early leaders professed admiration for European fascists. Its path has sometimes been rocky. The RSS was banned in 1948, when a former member assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. It was proscribed again in the 1970s, and then in the early 1990s.

Yet even during those periods its ideas have resonated with many Hindus, particularly the pious and those who crave the sense of belonging the organisation can provide. And over the past decade the RSS has greatly benefited from Mr Modi’s huge popularity—just as the prime minister has benefited from its endorsement.

A degree of pragmatism has also helped the organisation endure. Early RSS leaders were wary of getting involved in politics; later ones saw it as a way to grow. Senior members have distanced themselves from some of their predecessors’ rhetoric (not least the stuff about fascists). And they have taken to stressing harder the scale of the RSS’s charity work, which now includes some 150,000 projects.

On some very core issues, too, the RSS has seemed willing to bend. Though it claims to champion cottage industry and Indian self-reliance, the organisation has largely accepted the BJP’s embrace of global

capital. Earlier this year Mr Bhagwat backed a popular call for India to carry out a caste census, even though the RSS (which likes to play down caste divisions among Hindus) had long opposed this.

But on one goal the RSS has not wavered: its wish to make India a Hindu- first nation. And in many regards, that mission is looking close to complete. Some long-prized objectives have been achieved, such as the deeply divisive construction of a temple on the ruins of a destroyed mosque in Ayodhya (approved by India’s Supreme Court). Hindutva has seeped into public life; even politicians who oppose the BJP see advantage in portraying themselves as committed Hindus. Many Muslims live, in practice, as second-class citizens.

In its moment of triumph, however, the RSS seems restless. In his speeches Mr Bhagwat warned darkly of threats to national unity. Organiser, the RSS publication, carries outlandish stories about supposed risks that Muslims and others pose to Hindu culture. The RSS is fuelled both by confidence and paranoia.

Can the RSS hang on to the clout it has accumulated? The answer depends somewhat on who succeeds Mr Modi; on the BJP’s electoral fortunes; and on how far its leaders remain willing to pander to the organisation’s chiefs. One thing, at least, is clear. Even if its direct links to political power in India deteriorate, its influence over Indian society will not quickly fade. ■
