It has been almost a year since President Donald Trump signed an executive order promising to build what he then called an Iron Dome for America, to shield the country from drones and missiles. The project, whose name has been gaudified to Golden Dome, is not as outlandish as it sounds. Missile threats are multiplying. In recent wars Ukraine, Israel and India have all demonstrated the value of robust anti-missile defences that save lives, protect infrastructure and buy time for leaders to make better decisions. But the scope of Mr Trump’s shield remains dangerously vague. If that does not change, it could simply become a costly and destabilising white elephant.

What is known about the Golden Dome? It includes many things that already exist, such as anti-missile interceptors in Alaska and California, as well as Patriot batteries similar to the ones protecting Ukraine today. It also includes many things that were already in the works before Mr Trump returned to the White House, such as efforts to build sensors that can track missiles, interceptors that can destroy those projectiles and software to stitch all that together.

There are some new bits, too. The most important is the commitment to build space-based interceptors (SBIs), which are small missiles carried aboard satellites in low-Earth orbit. The idea is that a defender can destroy a missile as it is taking off, when its red-hot plume is easier to spot, rather than when a small warhead is streaking rapidly through space. Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush toyed with the idea as part of their missile defence initiatives in the 1980s, though the scheme fizzled out.

The problem with Mr Trump’s plan is that it is still unclear what Golden Dome is supposed to do. Will it modestly improve America’s ability to shoot down drones and handfuls of conventional cruise missiles fired by China towards military bases in the continental United States during a war over Taiwan? Will it parry small salvos of warheads launched by a second-tier nuclear power like North Korea? Or will it block hundreds of Russian and Chinese warheads in a full-blown nuclear exchange, neutralising their ability to threaten America’s existence?

The answers to these questions matter greatly. Experts calculate that a smallish Golden Dome, focused on parrying small incoming salvos, might cost just over $250bn over 20 years, a modest sum by the standards of America’s annual defence spending. But a full-fat version with tens of thousands of SBIs in orbit—a key factor driving up cost—could run to $3.6trn, a vast sum that would cannibalise America’s armed forces. That would not only be wasteful, but it might also induce adversaries to expand their own arsenals more than they otherwise would. A degree of mutual vulnerability is an inherent part of stable nuclear deterrence.

Mr Trump needs to set out what he aims to achieve with Golden Dome in broad terms, beyond his airy promises of blanket protection on the cheap. He should choose a modest expansion in the number of ground-based

interceptors already operating in Alaska and California, provided that the system gets better at telling apart decoys from real warheads. That should occur alongside an investment in space-based sensors that can track cruise missiles and hypersonic gliders more effectively. There is bipartisan support in America for both steps. Exotic SBIs to zap missiles can wait.

Missile defence is always a balance. Too little and your country is dangerously vulnerable—more than ever in an age when even militia groups like the Houthis in Yemen can operate ballistic missiles of extraordinary range. Too much, and you provoke an arms race in which the attacker is likely to have a cost advantage. Mr Trump is right to shore up America’s defences. But he should resist the temptation to gold-plate the Golden Dome. ■
