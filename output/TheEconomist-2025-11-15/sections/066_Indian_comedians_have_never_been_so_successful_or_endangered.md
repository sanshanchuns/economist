ON THE INSIDE Habitat looks like any other comedy club. The audience in Mumbai, buzzing and eager to laugh even on a sweltering Thursday evening, had to pack in tight near the small stage. The first act, Niveditha Prakasam, did some expert crowd work, gently ribbing a group of colleagues on a work outing. Following her a succession of other comics did their “tight ten” in English, Hindi or both. On the outside, however, there are clues that this Habitat is endangered. The comedy club is tucked into a busy side street near the Khar railway station, but there are no signs advertising where it is. Most would walk straight past what appears to be a closed shop. The only evidence to the contrary is the

loitering groups of young professionals, who are ushered in shortly before the show begins.

The club is not struggling financially: Habitat’s owner, Balraj Singh Ghai, has expanded the space several times to meet demand and is opening another club in Pune soon. The furtiveness is because Habitat has been repeatedly vandalised by mobs who cannot take a joke. The most recent attack, in March, came after Kunal Kamra used the word gaddar (traitor) in apparent reference to the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra. This is the scowl- smile paradox of comedy in India: it has never been more dangerous—or more popular.

Performers face a very real prospect of violence. Vir Das has said he received 50,000 death threats after a set about the “two Indias” in 2021. (He said that his countrymen “worship women during the day and gang rape them at night”.) In October police in Delhi arrested members of a gang who were planning to murder Munawar Faruqui. The comedian had been jailed for five weeks in 2021, having been arrested for “hurting religious sentiments”.

Mr Kamra warns that “it’s getting very claustrophobic” for comedians in the country. After the attack on Habitat, he moved to Puducherry and stepped back from public performance. He estimates that his fellow jokesters expend about “30% of [their] energy” worrying about whom they might offend. Though outré stand-ups in the West may get heckled or have a few shows cancelled, in India the danger is graver. “You just need one idiot,” Mr Kamra says, to “cause a stampede”.

Freedom of expression for artists, journalists and other critics has deteriorated under Narendra Modi’s government. Freedom House, a think- tank, classifies India as “partly free” alongside countries such as El Salvador and Mozambique. India’s constitution claims to guarantee freedom of speech, but it makes exceptions for the sake of “public order, decency or morality”.

It also states that “no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty”, which the Supreme Court has ruled includes a right to dignity. This allows anyone who feels a joke transgresses that right, or is indecent, to file a police

complaint—or indeed multiple complaints with multiple police agencies. Though comedians may not be fined or jailed for every complaint, police are required to investigate, which means comedians spend time and money defending themselves.

So why do they keep going? Though there are many in India who would like to gag comedians, there are many more who love the gags. In 2023 a study by Nielsen, a market-research firm, found that comedy was the most popular genre among Indians who stream tv shows and movies. Many stand-ups are famous: Zakir Khan and Anuvab Pal have performed sold-out gigs across the world. Kapil Sharma—who has 46m followers on Instagram, many more than Ricky Gervais (5m) or Trevor Noah (9m)—recently released the third season of his show on Netflix.

Mr Das describes the evolution of India’s comedy scene in his new memoir, “The Outsider”. He set up Mumbai’s first English-language open-mic event in the late 2000s, which led to roles in films, American tours and a couple of Netflix specials. He financed, promoted and produced his first open-mic nights and comedy shows himself. During the covid pandemic, when clubs closed, he moved to a small village in Goa, bought a microphone and speakers and proceeded to “do stand-up for small crowds, outdoors”. This became a series called “Ten on Ten”: ten sets, each about a topic suggested by his audience, such as “What is Freedom of Speech?”. This let Mr Das show off his range and intellectual curiosity.

Needless to say, he is very funny. (He says colonising India for cinnamon, “the one spice we use least in Indian cooking”, is like “colonising England for sunlight”.) Despite succeeding as a touring stand-up, as well as the challenges of the comedy scene at home, Mr Das resisted the temptation to move to Hollywood. He felt the best roles he could have hoped for would have been “a delivery guy who appears in one or two scenes in the new Nicole Kidman movie [or] the sassy but conservative Indian accountant who ‘tells it like it is’.”

Indeed some Indian comedians feel they have an obligation to stand up and be heard. “Censorship has captured most of the arts,” explains Vinay Shukla, a documentary film-maker. “Over the last ten years, comics have taken on the establishment much more directly than other art forms.” Films, television

shows and plays require funding and a crew—and often need an official censor’s approval. Books need publishers. Comedy, by contrast, is decentralised: comedians speak for themselves and need only a microphone. Their mode is cheap, portable and, in the age of social media, easily disseminated: comics can speak to the nation from a single stage or desk. “Kunal Kamra would be recognised at any airport,” says Mr Shukla.

The man himself is more philosophical. “What keeps taking me back to comedy is risk: the fact that there’s something nobody else is saying,” explains Mr Kamra. “I feel it’s a disservice to comedy not to take that risk.” He admits that his personal circumstances—he is unmarried and does not have children—mean that he is wagering less than others in taking those risks.

There is a serious need for the funny business, Mr Kamra suggests. By broaching thorny topics in an accessible way, stand-ups widen the boundaries of public discourse. “With so many people appointing themselves the cultural police, someday you’ll speak your mind, and someone will be offended, and you’ll find yourself caught in the same sort of panic.” ■
