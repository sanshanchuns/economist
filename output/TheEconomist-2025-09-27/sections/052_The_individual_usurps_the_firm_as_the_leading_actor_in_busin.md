The concentration of value in America’s stockmarket is staggering. So is the concentration of individual power. Four of the ten most valuable firms— Alphabet, Berkshire Hathaway, Meta and Oracle—are controlled by the men who built them. Tesla, a fifth, is heaping shares on its boss, Elon Musk. Nvidia, the most valuable of all, lacks a supreme shareholder. But Jensen Huang, its founder, has run the show for more than 30 years. “You are taking over the world,” President Donald Trump told Mr Huang recently. This is true not only of corporate America’s household names. From little- known programmers and hedge-fund managers to celebrated writers and singers, superstars’ influence and earnings are through the roof. Politicians

have trained their gaze on the top 1%. But the most telling shift in the labour market is playing out higher in the stratosphere. Likewise, stockmarket analysts spend little time thinking about individuals. They should spend more. Technology and culture are conspiring to make the individual, rather than the firm, the animating force of commercial life.

The trend is starkest in Silicon Valley, where moguls are betting the house on artificial intelligence (AI). Middle managers, whose numbers swelled during the 2010s, are out of favour. Superstar AI researchers are in. The view that the best hundred are exponentially more valuable than the next best is widespread. Meta’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, has reportedly offered eight- and nine-figure packages to hotshot programmers in his effort to catch up with OpenAI. Sam Altman, the Chat-GPT-maker’s boss, has said that a “medium-sized handful” of people are expected to achieve major breakthroughs in the industry. Mr Musk has called the frenetic bidding the “craziest talent war” he has ever seen.

The war for talent is also raging elsewhere. Hedge funds’ pursuit of star portfolio managers has never been so frenzied. Corporate consiglieri are increasingly free agents. The share of fees going to boutique investment banks, where bankers take a higher cut of the profits they bring in, has doubled since the global financial crisis of 2007-09. One of these, Evercore, recently agreed to pay $196m for Robey Warshaw, a tiny British firm.

In the law, too, the best are pulling away from the rest. Partners at the top ten American firms are 40% more profitable than those at the next ten. This has accelerated the demise of the industry’s socialistic compensation model, in which pay is based on tenure. Big-money transfers between white-shoe law firms used to be rare (and lamented), but are now common.

Anyone can be a “content creator” these days. But the giants of show business are bigger than ever. Top films and songs are gobbling up a growing share of audiences’ attention. Since 2017 the number of artists earning more than $10m from Spotify has increased by three times as much as the number earning above $100,000. Celebrities are also starting their own consumer brands at a record pace. Some, like Kim Kardashian and Hailey Bieber, have been hugely successful. Meanwhile writers have shunned the collective endeavour of the newspaper for Substack, a

subscription-based blog website which recently raised money at nearly twice the valuation of the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s 170-year-old right-wing paper of record.

Superstardom has a long history. As far back as 1890 Alfred Marshall, a British economist, asked why the wealth of individuals “exceptionally favoured by genius and good luck” far exceeded those of only modest talent in the same field.

The reason is that lesser talent is often a poor substitute for greater. The pleasure of hearing a great pianist far outweighs that of listening to two good ones. Sherwin Rosen, an American economist, observed in 1981 that a surgeon with a slightly better track record should charge more than a little above his competitors’ rate. Mass communication, Marshall noted even in his day, makes the superstar premium heftier: the bigger the audience, the bigger the loot of the talented.

Now the superstar effect is reaching new heights. A roaring stockmarket helps. But there are also deeper causes. Rapid technological progress means firms, particularly in technology and finance, are racing to capture market share. Because the best employees can confer a winning advantage, firms will fight to get them.

In tech, the race to dominate AI is the main spur. Firms expect enormous rewards if they can make breakthroughs first. When they are collectively spending $400bn annually on the physical infrastructure to train and run AI models, it makes little sense to skimp on the brains that exploit these resources. Researchers with their names on key academic papers have been showered with golden offers of employment. Startups have raised billions based on the credentials of their engineers.

Non-compete agreements, which limit employees’ ability to move, are unenforceable in California. This adds to engineers’ bargaining power and lets them switch jobs rapidly. Sometimes very rapidly: in July two researchers at Anthropic said they were quitting for Anysphere, a smaller AI firm, only to be hired back weeks later.

Closer scrutiny of acquisitions by antitrust authorities has added a further impetus. Google has signed billion-dollar licensing agreements with Windsurf and Character.ai, two startups, while hiring their star researchers. Microsoft did something similar with Inflection, another startup, when it hired Mustafa Suleyman, who was also a founder of DeepMind, now part of Google. (Mr Suleyman is on the board of The Economist’s parent company.) This year Meta paid $15bn for a stake in Scale AI and made its founder, Alexandr Wang, the boss of its AI division.

Some deals leave all but the sought-after engineers in the cold. This worries bosses less than it might have done a few years ago. Amazon says it is increasing its “builder ratio”, between makers and managers. Recent lay-offs at Microsoft and Google hit middle managers particularly hard. (This in turn is a cause of grief at America’s business schools. Between 2018 and 2022 big tech firms hired an average of 133 graduates from four top MBA programmes. Last year they hired 50.)

Technology has also created more winner-takes-most markets on Wall Street. Combined with bank-squeezing post-crisis regulation, it has concentrated power in firms with fewer, cleverer employees.

That is particularly true among trading firms providing liquidity, which rely on small numbers of smart people using vast computing resources. In the second quarter Jane Street, the largest, made $6.9bn in net profit with around 3,000 employees. Hudson River Trading, which has about 1,000 staff, made $1.6bn. All 46,000 people employed by Goldman Sachs managed just $3.7bn. The battle for talent among “multi-manager” hedge funds like Citadel and Millennium, where portfolio managers operate autonomously, is especially fierce. These huge funds are able to charge the costs of their employees directly to investors, cementing the advantages of scale (eg, infrastructure, leverage) and creating a price-insensitive arms-race for talent.

Often hedge funds and AI labs are chasing the same sorts of mathematical whizzes. In contrast with tech, however, the market for hedge-fund talent is notoriously illiquid and opaque. Trading firms have little idea of what their competitors are up to. A new law in Florida even permits four-year non- competes. One quant at a top firm says that his promised future compensation stretches out so far, and his three-year non-compete is so onerous, that it is unlikely another firm would bother to hire him. Not yet 30, he is probably in his last job. When poaching does occur, it can lead to nasty brawls. Jane Street sued Millennium last year after the fund hired two of its traders who had pulled off a particularly profitable trade in India.

The heightened superstar effect also owes much to communications technology. Reaching a bigger pool of clients and fans is becoming ever easier and cheaper. This allows superstars to strike out on their own and keep the bulk of the rewards. The logic is more powerful in media and entertainment. Writers can shift to Substack knowing that they do not need to invest in a distribution network. Those who might have once posed in Playboy now bare all on OnlyFans, a porn platform. A similar idea has gripped Silicon Valley, where plucky founders dream about vibe-coding their way to ten-figure valuations.

That the socially conscious capitalism of the early 2020s has fallen out of favour has surely put wind in the sails of the frenetic pursuit of IQ, particularly in Silicon Valley. There, James Burnham’s “The Managerial Revolution”, published in 1941, has become a popular antidote to corporate collectivism. Ordinary folk venerate the individual, too. A generation ago they might have read Ayn Rand. They now watch Ashton Hall, an

impossibly muscular TikTokker showing off his relentless routine of self- improvement, on their phones.

Executives have not just been made of America’s top celebrities, but celebrities of America’s top executives. Podcasts are now the primary method of communication for some CEOs. Retail investors have turned the stockmarket into a game show where entertaining sages are rewarded. Mr Musk is the best example. Alex Karp, the boss of Palantir, who recently instructed the retail army bidding up its overvalued stock to “stop talking to all the haters”, is another. The importance of one-to-one negotiations between bosses and Mr Trump, himself the archetypal celebrity capitalist, over tariffs and other state interventions is another reason to take a smile seriously.

Some worry that the focus on big personalities is a signal of a market bubble. Firms could, of course, overspend on top talent. Mr Huang’s leather jacket and Mr Zuckerberg’s muscular reinvention will, in hindsight, look like warnings if so. The structural causes of superstardom, though, are here to stay. ■
