Letters are welcome via email to letters@economist.comFind out more about how we process your letter Your article on African conservation was gloomy about the prospects for carbon markets, yet positive about philanthropically funded programmes (“Save a tree, make a mint”, October 25th). Charity cannot sustain conservation at scale. The only sustainable path forward is a credible market-based system that makes conservation a true financial proposition without depending on aid or philanthropy.

You mentioned concerns about greenwashing, yet dismissed the voluntary carbon market, which is actually the largest non-philanthropic financing mechanism for protecting Africa’s landscapes. True, there have been some struggles, but reforms are accelerating in transparency and integrity. Initiatives such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, the Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets and the Natural Climate Solutions Alliance are changing the game. High-integrity projects are multiplying beyond Democratic Republic of Congo, the focus of your article. Where quality standards apply we are seeing significantly higher prices and transaction volumes.

Governments have an essential role in policies that set fair pricing frameworks, secure land rights and establish rules, but they won’t write cheques indefinitely. Markets can. Not as substitutes for corporate decarbonisation, but as complementary finance rewarding conservation and improving durability on the ground. COP30 in Brazil offers the perfect venue to align these systems.

Luisa Neubauer made a strong case for urgent climate action, but she could have reflected on the criticisms of her own green movement (By Invitation, October 31st). To regain broad public consensus, climate activists must rethink their strategy. First, they should engage in political debate only when climate itself is at stake. Take Greta Thunberg’s recent involvement in Gaza as an example. Such headlines dilute the green movement’s message and allow opponents to frame climate action as partisan. To build durable, cross- party support for generations to come, climate advocacy should act more like serious institutions with long-term mandates, akin to central banks or sovereign-wealth funds.

Second, the movement must embrace pragmatism. Framing climate as the supreme issue above all others alienates voters who feel their immediate needs are being dismissed. Instead, activists should highlight synergies with current priorities, such as how climate policies can deliver affordable energy, enhance national security and reduce migration pressures. If climate activists do not tackle the evolving everyday concerns of citizens they may come to

be seen as what Sahra Wagenknecht, a German politician, once called “lifestyle leftists”.

The theory of why the ultra-rich are giving up on luxury assets and switching to exclusive services, such as a Michelin meal (“The parable of Château d’Yquem”, October 18th), was fully developed by Fred Hirsch in his “Social Limits to Growth”. The book came out in 1976 but was recently republished by Routledge. Hirsch came up with the concept of “positional goods”, the value of which was dependent on their relative position in granting status, prestige or advantage rather than intrinsic value. He was a finance editor at The Economist in the 1960s before working for the IMF and going into academia.

The analysis in your special report on the rich world’s debt crisis was correct (October 18th). One solution to this would be to cut tax loopholes, tax subsidies and so on. It is politics, not economics, that lies behind every country’s tax code. Donald Trump’s “big beautiful” act is a good example. It is full of tax giveaways that will cost trillions of dollars and shift wealth from the middle- and lower-economic classes to the top 10% and mostly the top 1%.

Money is a big influence in politics. Voters feel beleaguered, but they should demand sweeping changes that would make taxes simpler, more efficient and fairer. This could mean removing different tax rates for different kinds of income, eliminating the differences in tax treatment for various forms of organisation, stopping transfer pricing and requiring unitary accounting.

Eliminating classes of hidden tax expenditures could greatly help in cutting the deficit. But this will first entail a public-awareness campaign of what the specific provisions in the tax code are and who benefits from them.

You credited Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher with establishing an orthodoxy for “justified and sustainable” public debt (“The coming debt emergency”, October 18th). Reagan did quite the opposite. At his inauguration in 1981 America’s public debt stood at a 50-year low of 31% of GDP. Under the 12 years of Reagan and George H.W. Bush, that ratio more than doubled, to 63%. In fact, the new orthodoxy that Reagan established in his party was for tax cuts, with delirious projections of increased revenue through growth. Before Reagan’s electoral victory, Bush memorably described this as “voodoo economics”. Bush faithfully continued the policy. His son, George W. Bush, gleefully resumed it, shredding the budget surpluses attained under Bill Clinton’s presidency.

Belgium deserves a mention as a good example of curtailing debt. In the early 1990s Belgium’s public debt reached about 135% of GDP. Determined to meet the Maastricht criteria for joining the euro, Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, led a disciplined consolidation drive. His governments curbed public-sector wage growth, co-ordinated federal and regional budgets and trimmed primary spending by roughly five percentage points of GDP while maintaining large primary surpluses.

By 2007 the debt ratio had fallen below 90%, which was achieved without relying on inflation or financial repression. That success, in a country with automatic wage-indexation and chronic political fragmentation, shows that democratic coalitions can still deliver sound finances when objectives are clear and shared.

Belgium’s quiet technocratic achievement is often overlooked. Yet it offers a reminder that fiscal discipline, patiently applied, can work even in complex democracies, and that inflating away debt, however tempting, risks a far greater corrosion of growth, equity and public trust.

The game of conkers, where two players try to smash each others golf-ball- sized seed of the horse chestnut tree, is in decline in Britain, you say (”Bonkers conkers”, October 18th). In a village not far from where we live

in the north of Dordogne in France, a British-owned pub, l’Entente Cordiale, recently hosted the 33rd championnat de France de conkers. It was rained off. You can’t get much more British than that.

I read your article about Britain’s cap on bus fares (“Whitehall takes the wheel”, October 18th). I was on a bus that arrived 20 minutes late, as it had for much of the previous week. I am drafting this letter sitting on the 90- minute return trip. The poor ventilation makes me grateful for my congestive cold. My fellow passengers are a rotating cast. The early riders are pensioners on morning errands. Gradually the bus repopulates with metropolitan types, business bags and noise-cancelling headphones. Capped and cheaper bus fares may curry favour with the pensioners, but the workers would gladly foot the bill for a spacious, punctual and preferably clean service.

Why persist? The alternatives are no better. A car would idle away in grinding traffic, a train requires three separate legs of a journey. A bus, for all its faults, at least gives me time to read.

As he is no longer Prince Andrew, here are several alternative honorifics that he could consider: the Duke of Hazard, the Royal Flush, His Former Highness, Count No-Account, the Windsor Formerly Known as Prince (“Parliament versus the prince”, October 25th).
