IN 1997 FRANCES CAIRNCROSS, then of The Economist, memorably proclaimed “the death of distance”. Dame Frances (as she has since become) argued in a book with this title that telecommunications technology was making geography irrelevant to business and personal lives. Some of her claims may have been overblown but, in one crucial respect, the thesis was bang on. With the exception of China, around which the Communist Party erected the cyberspatial ramparts of the Great Firewall, distance was, in all markets that mattered, dead online. Today distance is back. On August 29th America stopped letting parcels containing goods worth less than $800 enter the country tariff-free. This old- economy rule, first enacted as part of the Tariff Act of 1930 to ease the

burden on overworked customs officials, has allowed new-economy businesses such as Shein and Temu, two Chinese e-merchants which used it with abandon, to conquer America by offering shoppers cut-price goods.

The demise of “de minimis”, as the exemption is known, is the latest, symbolic reminder to digital darlings that frontiers exist—and that business models built on their absence are in need of a rethink. The eu is beginning to enforce new rules for the bloc’s online economy and finalising those for artificial intelligence (ai). Any day now Eurocrats are expected to punish X over inadequate content cleansing in its social-media sewer. In April they fined Apple €500m ($582m) and Meta €200m for not complying with the Digital Markets Act (dma), which dictates what tech giants can and cannot do in its 27 member states. Countries from Australia to Brazil are considering similar laws.

No one has more at stake from distance’s rebirth than Apple, Meta and their big-tech peers, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft. All five have built their multitrillion-dollar valuations on business models that worked the same way pretty much everywhere. Some translation into individual markets’ vernaculars was necessary. Different rules for consumer protection had to be obeyed. Apple’s Chinese app store could not offer software disfavoured by the communists. But by and large, compliance costs were, in the words of one big-tech bigwig, marginal.

Now the online world is splintering into national or regional internets. This is forcing the tech quintet to navigate an uncomfortable trade-off between containing costs of compliance that have become suddenly material and maintaining market access in suddenly tetchy jurisdictions.

The simplest way to limit costs is to forsake places with onerous rules altogether. In 2023 Canada passed a law requiring internet platforms to pay news outlets for links in their search results or social-media feeds. Google, which is owned by Alphabet, duly handed over C$100m ($72m) to a government-run fund. Meta, by contrast, concluded that this was not a price worth paying and instead blocked links to news sites on Canadian users’ Facebook and Instagram accounts.

Any hit to Meta’s revenues was probably nugatory; news makes up just 3% of the Facebook feed globally. However, as rules spread—Canada’s, for instance, were based on a similar Australian law—the exit option becomes less palatable. This is especially true if these rules affect larger markets and less peripheral bits of big tech’s business.

Alphabet’s experience in China, the outlier where distance lived on, offers something resembling a natural experiment. In 2010 Google left the country rather than censor its search results as the Communist Party demanded. At the time it was estimated to be making $300m or so a year in the country, just over 1% of its global sales. That, Google concluded, was less than the cost of reputational damage had it kowtowed. It was almost certainly right. Yet the opportunity cost was real. Even if its business in China had grown merely as briskly as that of Apple in the period since, it would have raked in cumulative Chinese sales of some $40bn. If its share of Chinese sales matched Apple’s 17% in 2024, it would have added $60bn that year alone.

Between a quarter and three-fifths of the quintet’s global revenues come from outside its lightly regulated, highly profitable home market. If more large foreign markets turn Chinese, exit will no longer be unpalatable but indigestible. Sadly, staying can still cause a nasty hiccup. The five giants are cagey about how much it costs them to tweak their systems in accordance with various new digital rules being introduced around the world. But last year Meta offered an inkling in its first DMA-mandated compliance report in Europe. It said that more than 11,000 of its employees devoted more than 590,000 hours of engineering and technical work over two years to make the requisite changes to its products.

One way of converting this into dollars is to look at the cost of technical labour. A median Meta worker’s compensation comes to $190 or so an hour (assuming a 40-hour work week, 21 days of annual leave and 12 paid public holidays). This puts the direct cost of those 590,000 hours at a modest $110m. But if you consider that the 11,000 workers could have spent this time generating revenue, and that the average Meta employee brought in $1.3m in 2022 and $2m in 2023, then the cost swells to $1bn in forgone sales over two years, equivalent to 2% of Meta’s European revenues in that time.

As engineers tinker, new products are stranded. Since 2023 Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft have all had to delay the European launches of various ai tools, often by many months. That gives smaller rivals spared the dma’s strictures a chance to steal market share. Some Europeans tired of waiting for an ai-enabled iPhone may have bought a Samsung instead. Big tech had better get used to grappling with more such predicaments—near and far. ■
