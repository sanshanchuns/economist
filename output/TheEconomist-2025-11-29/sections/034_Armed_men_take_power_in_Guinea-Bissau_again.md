After a two-year lull, during which optimists could have imagined the contagion had stopped, Africa appears to have experienced two coups in as many months. On November 26th army officers in Guinea-Bissau, a tiny west African country of 2m people, became the latest military faction to call time on civilian government. They followed their peers in Madagascar, who intervened in the name of solving a political crisis on the island in October. It is still too early to know the true intentions of Guinea-Bissau’s putschists. But

should they prevail, theirs would be the 11th successful coup in Africa this decade, a far higher tally than in the 2000s or the 2010s.

The officers who announced the takeover claimed to have seized “total control” of the government for an indefinite period. Appearing on state TV shortly after gunfire was heard near the presidential palace in Bissau, the capital, they said they had closed the country’s borders and suspended its ongoing electoral process. Umaro Sissoco Embaló, the incumbent president, was arrested. In a phone call to France 24, a news outlet, he said he had been “deposed”. A key opponent of the president, as well as the army chief and his deputy, are also reported to have been detained.

Two key elements lie behind the crisis. The first is Guinea-Bissau’s chronic political instability. The country’s politics has been characterised by a succession of coups—this is at least the tenth attempt at one since independence from Portugal in 1974—and combustible elections.

The latest electoral dispute was triggered by Mr Embaló’s heavy-handed attempt to win a second term. Both he and his rival, Fernando Dias da Costa, claimed to have won before results of the election on November 23rd were formally announced. The electoral commission had been due to weigh in on November 27th.

A related factor is Guinea-Bissau’s role as a hub for the global cocaine trade. The powerful army has long had links to international drug traffickers, who are so enmeshed in the country’s politics that Colombian drug lords can be spotted driving luxury cars around Bissau.

Guinea-Bissau’s cocaine trade has flourished under Mr Embaló, says Lucia Bird of the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime, a think- tank, fuelling suspicions that the president and his allies were benefitting from it.

Many in Guinea-Bissau question whether this is a “normal coup”, says Ms Bird. Suspicions are rife that the president orchestrated a coup attempt as a pretext for retaining power, whatever the result of the election.

For now, that is speculation. But it is not the first time the president has been accused of using the spectre of a coup to grab power. Mr Embaló dissolved

parliament following an alleged coup attempt in 2023 and has ruled without a legislature ever since. After he came to power in 2020 following another disputed election, the army occupied state offices before his inauguration. A putsch favouring the government would be unusual. But unusual things happen in Guinea-Bissau. ■
