Those hoping to pay their respects to Jiang Zemin, a deceased former president of China, will not find a tombstone. As befits a leader of the Communist Party, he was a “thoroughgoing materialist” (read: unsentimental), according to official media. So after he died in 2022 he was cremated and his ashes scattered into the ocean off Shanghai. The city is now hoping more people will follow Jiang’s example. This month it said it would give 3,000 yuan ($420) to residents who agree to give their deceased relatives a “sea burial”. Until recently, such a thing would have been taboo. Chinese families have often spent grandly on tombs that honour dead relatives. Every year they return to clean the tomb and burn offerings. In rural China some farmers still

prepare their own coffins and gravesites well in advance. In Chinese, the phrase “to die without a burial spot” is used as a curse (and is often the fate of villains in novels). But a change in attitudes is under way.

The party has long seen elaborate tombs as a backward tradition and, worse, a waste of good land—which is in short supply in cities. In rural areas it could otherwise be used to plant crops. The party has banned tombs outside authorised cemeteries. In built-up areas it has (in theory) made cremations compulsory. Officials think ashes are then best disposed of in nature, or efficiently packed into a niche in a columbarium. Government regulations on the funeral industry have railed against “superstition, vulgarity, and extravagance”. But attitudes towards death have proved fairly hard to shift. China’s cremation rate rose to about 50% by the 2000s and then flattened out. And even in places where cremation rates are very high, many families still think the best place to store urns containing their relatives’ ashes is under a large, ornate tombstone.

Lately, the party seems to have been having more success. China’s cremation rate started rising again in 2017. It reached 59% in 2021, the last year for which there are official data. And Chinese people also appear to be spending strikingly less on tombs. Fu Shou Yuan, a high-end undertaker, saw revenues decline by 44% in the first half of 2025 year on year, mainly because its tombs were selling for much less per plot. That was the first time it had posted a loss since it listed 12 years ago. China’s other listed funeral companies also saw sales slump in this period.

What is hurting demand? China is ageing rapidly, and so has no shortage of deaths. But its economy is stumbling amid a property crisis that has slashed the value of many people’s assets. That may be shifting priorities. Shelling out for a fancy tomb can cost as much as 200,000 yuan ($28,000) in Beijing for just the first 20 years. After that it takes further payments to hang on to the spot. Increasingly, families are opting for their relatives’ ashes to be buried under smaller tombs, in a columbarium, or even under a collective gravestone that is inscribed with the names of dozens of other people.

For those who are willing to go without any marker at all, many parts of China now offer cash incentives for what officials call “ecological” burials. This encompasses practices such as scattering ashes under a tree or in a

bamboo grove, as well as the sea burials that are being promoted by Shanghai. Nationwide the total number of such burials last year was 194,700. That is still only 3.2% of the total, but it is 67% more than in 2019.

A worker at Taiziyu cemetery, located in south-west Beijing, says that saving money is not the only reason Chinese people are growing more willing to go without a tomb. She says many of China’s elderly want to spare their children the duty of visiting their grave. Her cemetery once had plans to expand into the nearby countryside. Now that may not happen, she says. After all, when burials are “ecological” the same areas of land (or sea) can be used again and again.

Not everyone seems completely comfortable with the new way of doing things. Outside the cemetery’s walls is a sign insisting that all spare land must be used for agriculture; it calls for all violators of this rule to be reported. A few metres away, half-hidden behind a patch of brush and guarded by stone lions, someone has erected a big white tombstone. ■
