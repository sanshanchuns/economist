Few queues move slower than the one to join the European Union—as those looking to be let in well know. Like eagerly primped teenagers loitering at the doors of a trendy nightclub hoping the velvet rope will finally be pulled back, the union’s wannabe members cling to their place in the queue convinced that persistence will one day be rewarded. Ukraine is the biggest of those still shivering on the fringes of a club whose warmth it can feel but not yet share. Will it soon be its turn to be invited in? The party looks fun and Ukraine can claim, as generations of revellers have tried, that “Honest, my mates are already inside!” Many ensconced within Club Europe are indeed keen for this new member to be waved through the accession process. Yet for now the thick-necked bouncer is impassive, muttering something about judicial reforms and absorption capacity. Should the wait

get much longer, tempers may start to fray. “Wait, is this queue even moving?”

Ukraine’s pining for Brussels is as old as its modern statehood. The country had barely recovered its independence when in 1993 it declared it wanted to join the EU, then a club of a mere dozen members. For many years the pleas to join were merely performative: Ukraine was too poor, too agrarian and too oligarch-ridden to be a credible member of the EU. In any case the doors of the club seemed bolted shut. Somewhat more credible aspirants, including six in the western Balkans, had made little progress in their own decades- long bids for accession; nobody has been let in since Croatia in 2013. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 rebooted the rationale for enlargement. Leaving countries near the EU but outside it made them ready targets to be courted (if not actually invaded) by geopolitical rivals, whether China or Russia. Giving Ukraine a shot at joining hinted at a brighter, more Western future worth fighting for.

Ukraine remains poor, agrarian and prone to oligarchic excess—and is at war, to boot. Nonetheless, it has made surprisingly steady headway through the EU’s demanding accession process, alongside some in the Balkans as well as Moldova. Having put in its application four days after Russia’s invasion, it was granted candidate status a few months later. In June 2024 the authorities in Kyiv formally opened negotiations to join, a process that requires any aspiring member to adopt decades-worth of EU law—a bureaucratic clobbering not even countries at peace manage easily. Civil servants at the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm gauging Ukraine’s progress, praised the reformist zeal they found in Kyiv. They gushed at how quickly it was jumping through the hoops, reforming its bent judiciary or stemming widespread corruption. A mooted deadline of 2030 seemed ambitious but not entirely outlandish.

Alas, momentum towards accession has flagged of late. Both Ukraine and the EU are to blame. On the Ukrainian side, some of the reformist fervour that once dazzled Eurocrats seems to have waned, as even government officials in Kyiv admit. Transformation continues, but at a less impressive pace. Vested interests—the beneficiaries of weak courts and dodgy public procurement, say—are pushing back against reforms. A clumsy attempt by President Volodymyr Zelensky to hobble two anti-corruption agencies in

July was greeted with horror in EU circles (and in Ukraine, where rare wartime protests ensued). Though the damage has been contained, the episode has highlighted how easily progress can be reversed, especially when reforms start to bite.

But the EU is also stuck. Any country advancing through the accession process requires the repeated agreement of every national government currently in the club. Hungary is vetoing Ukraine moving to the next stage of talks. Viktor Orban, its prime minister and the EU leader most resembling an unco-operative doorman, faces an election next April and thinks Ukraine- bashing will help his cause. Ukrainians are being asked to display “strategic patience” as a fix is crafted. At least the path to accession seems open for some: the likes of Albania and Montenegro are making steady progress, and might manage to join by 2030.

One of the EU’s founding principles poses an intractable problem for both the union and those looking to join it. Unlike rowdy revellers at a nightclub, those let into the EU cannot be kicked out. Many of the bloc’s most important decisions, such as on foreign policy and sanctions, must be taken unanimously. So letting in a single party-pooper (like Mr Orban, say) could spoil the club’s ambience. That makes many even beyond Budapest anxious to ensure Ukrainian adherence to the rule of law is enduring. What if Ukraine or Moldova is let in and the “wrong” party comes to power one day, leaving a Kremlin toady at the EU’s top table?

Hence the talk in Brussels is of “creative solutions” to help move past the thickening stalemate. One proposal is old-hat: to let Ukraine and others be closely associated with the EU, benefiting from its single market and free movement for citizens, but still remaining outside the club itself. Yet such second-tier status would be considered a betrayal for Ukraine. More promisingly, there is muttering of Ukraine formally joining the club, but with caveats. In a big wave of enlargement in 2004, Poland and others had to accept their citizens gaining access to most richer European countries’ labour markets only after seven years of membership. This latest batch of joiners might have to agree to transition periods during which they might not have the same veto powers as existing members, for example. Some even moot the idea of a transition period during which new member states falling short of EU standards could be booted out entirely. That would twist the

club’s laws in ways that many would think harsh. But might it persuade the bouncer to finally lift the rope? ■
