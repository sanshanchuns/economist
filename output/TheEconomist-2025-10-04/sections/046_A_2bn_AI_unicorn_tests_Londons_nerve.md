THIS SUMMER Sir Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, opened a new glass- fronted office block in the centre of the capital. Its tenant was Synthesia, a firm that turns written prompts into slick videos with digital avatars. Sir Sadiq joked that his aides would welcome an avatar of him—better dressed and reliably on script. On the subject of Synthesia, however, he was less modest. The firm, he said, was a great “London success story”. For once the cheerleading was justified. Synthesia is one of the largest British generative-artificial-intelligence (AI) firms by revenue. It has more than 500 staff, claims to sell to four-fifths of America’s Fortune-100 companies, and in April crossed $100m in annual recurring revenue—a benchmark for startups. Valued at over $2bn, it is one of the few AI unicorns

Britain can claim. Yet it is also a test of Britain’s ambition to build tech titans (the government hopes to see a trillion-dollar home-grown tech company). Whether Synthesia stays in London will show how realistic those aims are. The outlook is cloudy.

Britain excels at nurturing young tech firms, helped by English as a global business language and its pull on Silicon Valley’s cast-offs. Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s Danish boss, had wanted to move to California but America denied him a visa. Instead he came to London, and thrived. There he met researchers from University College London who were working on real-time digital avatars. In 2017, together with a few others, they created Synthesia. Early backers included Mark Cuban, an American billionaire and then-owner of a National Basketball Association franchise, but also London- based investors (contrary to what its detractors say, the city is by far Europe’s biggest venture-capital hub).

At first Synthesia chased attention. In 2018 it helped David Beckham, better known for his footballing prowess than his linguistic fluency, to speak nine languages for a charity campaign. (The hype around such tech was echoed on September 30th when OpenAI launched Sora 2, which enables users to create impressive videos.) Synthesia’s niche is corporate customers. Instead of making employees wade through training packs and PowerPoints, clients can churn out polished video clips in dozens of languages at a fraction of the cost. Users choose from hundreds of avatars modelled on actors; confident David Brent types can record their own.

To stay ahead, Synthesia is improving its avatars’ body language. It is also expanding its products. Its platform enables users to script, edit, translate and publish entire videos on-site. Coming next are interactive AI “agents” that can role-play a sales call, train a new hire or give instant feedback. Such enterprise software is not the sort of AI that grabs headlines, but it is the sort that makes money.

Investors value Synthesia at about 20 times sales, a rich multiple—though far lower than the latest startups coming out of the AI boom with equivalent multiples in the hundreds. Trust helps. Unlike rivals chasing clicks with deepfakes, Synthesia restricts political and sexual content and moderates content tightly. Misuse still happens: its software has spread disinformation

as far afield as Burkina Faso and Venezuela. Even so, says Oguz Acar, a marketing professor at King’s College London, its focus on “responsible AI” has become central to its brand.

So far, so good for Britain (though the AI boom has not yet translated into plentiful domestic jobs, profits and tax revenues). The troubles come later, when growing firms either choose to list their shares in America, where capital markets are deeper, or sell out to global giants.

Quantexa, a data-analytics firm, is the latest rumoured to be heading for the Big Apple; Synthesia could yet follow. A lack of risk appetite is part of the problem. Mr Riparbelli laments “old money” that prefers “rent-seeking” to innovation. He is scathing about London’s stockmarket, which is bleeding companies: “It looks more like a hospice than a stock exchange.”

A foreign listing or takeover would not automatically strip Britain of jobs or taxes. DeepMind, the AI arm of Alphabet, Google’s parent, is still based in London, where it was founded. But such things can send a strong message about where the momentum for an industry lies. Witness the gloomy reaction in Britain when on September 29th AstraZeneca, the country’s largest drugmaker, announced that it would list its shares on New York’s stockmarket (while keeping its listing in London). Analysts fretted that Britain was losing its edge in a key industry.

Given that Britain’s best hope of tapping into the AI boom is in applied AI— profitable products built on top of large language models—keeping front- runners like Synthesia is crucial. “If we’re serious about generating global tech giants, then we need companies like Elevenlabs and Synthesia,” says Lewis Maconachy of Index Ventures, a venture-capital firm.

Policymakers know this. That is why Sir Sadiq and the business secretary, Peter Kyle, turned up at Synthesia’s summer party. Ministers are easing listing rules and have signed a new Anglo-American tech pact. Yet signals remain mixed. Treasury officials still resist scrapping stamp duty on share trading, for example—a quick revenue raiser but a brake on liquidity. Without bolder reform, what is today’s London success story may become a reminder of what Britain let slip.■
