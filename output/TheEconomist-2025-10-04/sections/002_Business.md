A consortium of investors led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund announced a buy-out of Electronic Arts, the video-game maker behind such hits as “Battlefield”, “EA Sports FC” and “Madden NFL”. At $55bn it is the world’s biggest-ever leveraged buy-out. Affinity Partners, an investment firm founded by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, is part of the consortium. The deal is a bet that artificial intelligence will enhance players’ interactions with EA’s games, and also cut its operating costs. The White House pulled its nomination of E.J. Antoni to head the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Donald Trump had nominated Mr Antoni, currently the senior economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, after sacking the previous head of the BLS for allegedly manipulating jobs figures to make the government look bad (for which there is no evidence). Mr Antoni’s

nomination had run into a wall of opposition in the Senate over his suitability for the job.

Brian Quintenz acknowledged that he is no longer the White House’s nominee to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, after the Senate held up his confirmation process. Mr Trump wants the CFTC to expand its remit in cryptocurrencies. Mr Quintenz has accused Tyler Winklevoss, the founder of a crypto exchange and supporter of Mr Trump, of trying to derail his nomination.

Analysts estimated a big increase of sales in electric vehicles in America as people rushed to claim tax credits on EV purchases before the programme ended on September 30th. “It’s been bonkers,” said a director at TrueCar, a retailing website, describing the dash to buy a car. Sales are expected to slow in the coming months.

The British government handed Jaguar Land Rover a £1.5bn ($2bn) loan guarantee, as the carmaker struggles to restart production following a cyber- attack on August 31st. JLR is having to rebuild its IT systems to pay suppliers, deliver vehicles to dealers and send out spare parts. The disruption to its supply chain could continue for months.

Nike said it now expects costs from tariffs to reach $1.5bn in its financial year, as it reported a 31% drop in quarterly net profit, year on year. Revenue grew by 1%. Sales were up in North America by 4%, thanks to clothing and equipment; sales from footwear in the region were flat. Overall sales dropped by 10% in China.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was reportedly ready to secure a deal to buy Occidental’s petrochemical division for $10bn. Berkshire is Occidental’s largest shareholder and backed the energy giant’s takeover of Anadarko in 2019. Occidental has struggled with the huge debts it incurred as a result of that takeover and other acquisitions.

Another blockbuster deal was taking shape, as Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by BlackRock, was said to be close to buying AES, a utility that owns and operates power plants, in a deal worth around $38bn. GIP’s

other assets include stakes in London’s Gatwick airport, renewables and big pipeline projects.

The planned merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern to create America’s first coast-to-coast freight operator continued to reverberate throughout the industry, as CSX, another railway company, ousted its chief executive. Ancora Holdings, an activist investor, had pressed CSX to appoint a new boss who is more amenable to a takeover offer, potentially from BNSF, in order to compete with the new freight giant.

California’s governor signed the first bill into law in America that compels companies to reveal their safety standards for AI. Gavin Newsom wants the legislation to lay the foundations for a national AI safety act. The bill is less expansive than a previous version that was dropped last year amid intense opposition from the likes of Meta and OpenAI.

A study from the Budget Lab at Yale University countered the idea that AI is already disrupting jobs, concluding that the effects on American labour markets are “largely speculative”. Looking at the 33-month period since the release of ChatGPT, the report found that AI is changing the occupational mix among tech workers, but not in the wider economy. Your job is not safe yet; the study also argues that the impact of AI on the occupational mix is bigger than it was for computers or the internet at the same stage in the cycle.

YouTube agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump for blocking his content after his supporters attacked Congress on January 6th 2021. The bulk of the $24.5m settlement will go to the Trust for the National Mall, which is helping finance a new White House state ballroom.
