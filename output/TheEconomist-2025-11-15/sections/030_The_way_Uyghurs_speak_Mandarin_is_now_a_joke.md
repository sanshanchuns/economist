Scroll through posts about Xinjiang on Chinese social media and an odd phrase soon appears: “Apple U”. It is a pun that mimics how some Uyghurs, the largest ethnic minority in Xinjiang, a region in China’s far north-west, pronounce “Hey, friend” in Mandarin. This meme is part of a growing trend online for using nang yan wen, or “naan Mandarin”—a way of writing and talking that wags have named after Xinjiang’s staple flatbread. Videos tagged with the term have amassed more than 1.7bn views on Douyin, TikTok’s sister app in China, since the start of the year. Mocking regional accents has long been a pastime within China. Mandarin (putonghua) itself was standardised from northern dialects under the country’s past leader Mao Zedong, who famously spoke it with a thick

Hunan accent. But what began as gentle parody risks shading into prejudice. State media and online influencers alike deploy “naan Mandarin” in ways that blur the line between comedy and condescension.

The meme also glosses over Xinjiang’s fraught linguistic past. In the decades after 1949, schools in autonomous regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet were permitted to teach the main subjects in their local languages. That space narrowed in the 1990s with the introduction of “bilingual education”. After 2000 such teaching grew more institutionalised and under Xi Jinping, China’s president since 2013, language use has increasingly become a political concern.

On his first visit to Xinjiang as China’s leader in 2014, Mr Xi said that mastering Mandarin would make it easier for local children to find jobs and help them “contribute more to promoting ethnic unity”. In 2017 China’s government ordered minority students to “master and use” standard Mandarin; it said it wanted it employed in 95% of classrooms, nationwide. Across many minority regions, subjects such as maths and literature are now taught in Mandarin, despite some protests from parents who fear that their children are losing their mother tongue—and with it, an important part of their identity.

Many children from minority groups now primarily speak Mandarin, so jokes about pronunciation truly sting. Besides, minorities more broadly, and in particular those who carry a Xinjiang hukou (household registration), face regular police checks and frequent discrimination. As a user from the region complained online recently, being addressed in “naan Mandarin” is not affectionate but belittling: “I’m not a child or a pet for you to tease,” the person wrote. “I spent years learning Mandarin so we could speak as equals.”■
