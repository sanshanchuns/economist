Letters are welcome via email to letters@economist.comFind out more about how we process your letter The Economist rarely misses an opportunity to plough a furrow through British agriculture, clearly viewing it as a legacy industry with scant prospects and little purpose other than to vacate the fields for built infrastructure (“Change in the land”, August 30th). Farming may contribute directly only 0.6% of gross value added to British GDP, but that is largely a reflection of the invidious position in which it finds itself, caught between the race-to-the-bottom global commodity markets, retailers demanding

champagne for lemonade prices and domestic consumers who expect cheap food to get ever cheaper. It’s a wonder we produce anything at all.

Indirectly, British agriculture is the bedrock of food and drink, Britain’s largest manufacturing sector. It provides the barley to support the jobs at the brewery in Suffolk you mentioned. And in a world of increasing climatic and geopolitical uncertainty, domestic agriculture provides Britain with something rather more fundamental than economic multipliers: the insurance policy of three meals a day, even if the premium continues to shrink.

The development of urban parts of Suffolk should be designed so that people who live in this new housing can move around and connect with the local community with good modern public transport, cycleways and walkways. Planners continue to approve housing developments on the edges of towns that follow the same pattern of encouraging car use, are not properly connected to the urban centre, and don’t use smart-energy solutions. This is not a good outcome over the long term.

I agree with your reading of Donald Trump’s defence of Jair Bolsonaro’s trial (“What Brazil can teach America”, August 30th). Only in 2025 could shielding a coup-plotter be dressed up as defending democracy. You captured well the risks of polarisation and the unusual power of Brazil’s supreme court. But you overlooked how the corruption history of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is equally a source of division.

I am no Bolsonarista. As a Brazilian living in Australia, I see how more equitable societies function. From that distance it is clear how Brazilians became trapped between a strongman who threatened institutions and a president who once emptied the coffers. Lula went to prison for corruption, then returned as if nothing had happened. The rise of Lula’s son hardly inspires faith in Brazil’s institutions.

If Brazil is to escape its cycle of populism, reforms must confront both extremes of Mr Bolsonaro’s authoritarianism and Lula’s entrenched cronyism. Brazil’s tragedy is not just one man in epaulettes or one in prison stripes, but a system that forces its people to choose between the two. Until that false choice is broken, no trial, coup or otherwise, will restore faith in Brazil’s democracy.

I agree that the judiciary is right to hold Mr Bolsonaro accountable. And that is precisely why I think the supreme court should have set the highest standards for his trial, instead of relying on a fake-news probe with a dubious legal basis. And by insisting on this shady inquiry, the supreme court eroded its own legitimacy. It fuelled the Bolsonaristas’ claims and amplified polarisation and mistrust in public institutions.

Today’s level of polarisation in Brazil is unprecedented. People framed the issue as a stand-off between the supreme court and Mr Bolsonaro. I see the opposite. It is precisely because Mr Bolsonaro needed to be punished that the court should have operated strictly according to the rule of law.

The justices on Brazil’s supreme court are notoriously partisan. Of the five justices sitting in judgment on Mr Bolsonaro, four were appointed by Presidents Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff from the leftist Workers’ Party: Cármen Lúcia, Luiz Fux, Cristiano Zanin and Flávio Dino. Mr Zanin was Lula’s lawyer, who successfully achieved the annulment of Lula’s convictions for corruption and ended his prison sentence. Mr Dino was Lula’s justice minister.

The fifth justice, Alexandre de Moraes, was appointed by President Michel Temer, but previously worked for Geraldo Alckmin, Lula’s vice-president, during his tenure as governor of São Paulo.

Brazil will remain a very bitterly divided nation.

Your discussion of “All-American silicon” (August 23rd) missed one important part of the menu. Building semiconductor fabs alone does not solve America’s chip-security problem if the silicon goes back to Asia for assembly. The Biden and Trump administrations focused on the silicon fab alone and ignored the required ecosystem that includes substrates in chip assembly. Without investment in the full supply chain neither the security issue nor the supply-chain problem will be solved.

The Telegram column asked if globalisation was ever a “meritocracy”, referencing the word’s positive connotations (August 23rd). Michael Young popularised that term in “The Rise of the Meritocracy”, published in 1958, to describe a future dystopia. It was originally intended as a satirical warning. In his chilling vision, a society that rewards “intelligence plus effort” creates a privileged elite that uses its control over education to confer “merit” upon its own families and acquaintances. This self-perpetuating cycle leads to a vast power imbalance and a starkly unequal society. The great irony is that we now use meritocracy to describe an aspirational goal, even as Young’s prophetic vision of a system where opportunity is controlled by a select few seems to be materialising. Perhaps it is time to retire the term or, at the very least, use it with a wry smile.

America’s fertility crash has reached a new low, you report, highlighting how pro-natalists in the Trump administration are searching for ways to incentivise higher birth rates (“Baby slump”, August 9th). Such incentives include reserving college places for those who have more children earlier in life and supplying larger homes to those with bigger families. Indeed, Mr Trump is considering a proposal that awards medals of motherhood to women with large families.

However, a key issue laid out in my book on natalism, “Nationalising Sex”, is that seemingly rational incentives at the macro level do not match the

actual micro-level decision-making of individuals. There is plenty of evidence suggesting that a couple’s decision to have a child is entirely uninfluenced by the prospect of winning a medal, securing a space in college or by tax breaks. Governments need to understand why, at the marginal level, a couple decides to have only one child instead of a second. It should then target the factors that actually sway such decisions, especially for those who would actually be influenced by external incentives. Otherwise we should expect to see more floundering policy and wasted taxpayer funds on programmes that fail.

We have just seen an interesting juxtaposition in policy styles between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump (“Marching orders”, September 6th). China’s leader holds a massive display of force accompanied by his allies, Russia and North Korea, following a seeming rapprochement with India. Mr Trump responds by renaming America’s Defence Department the Department of War. The contrast is striking, but no amount of postmodern politics, wordplay and linguistic manoeuvring can counter the geopolitical shift away from America’s global dominance that Mr Trump is causing.

As a retired lieutenant-colonel in the American army, I watched the Chinese military parade in awe and wondered how many months did those poor troops practise for this spectacle. It is absolutely true that American forces are bad marchers, mainly because we do so little of it, and for good reason. It is a waste of time when the troops should instead be in the field honing their skills for war. I remember how impressive the East German military looked at the country’s 40th anniversary parade in 1989. Within a year East Germany was no more.

I read your review of the #MeToo adaptation of “The Crucible” (“From hero to zero”, August 16th). It should be noted that Arthur Miller’s character of John Proctor in that play, a fictional account of the Salem witch trials, was based on a real person who was executed for witchcraft. The affair with Abigail Williams, who led the accusations of witchery, was a dramatic device invented by Miller. In fact, some of the motivation behind Proctor’s prosecution may have been that he was outspoken in defending his wife, who was also accused of practising the dark arts before him. If not an outright hero, Proctor stood up for truth and rationality at the cost of his life. The fact that his name and reputation are being assaulted in “John Proctor is the Villain” in the name of the latest witch hunt is truly ironic.

I was struck by the finding that Generation Z is unhappier than previous generations (“Teenage angst”, August 30th). Especially by comparison with the Silent Generation, born from 1929 to 1945. Which suggests that a global economic depression and war are better for you than social media.

Free Exchange in the August 9th issue examined whether income or happiness will make your life better. It reminded me that since my late teens

I’ve been absolutely baffled that so few people consider the value of their time when choosing how to live their life. Most agree that more money will make you happier. But on your death bed, will you regret that you spent so much of your life working?

Henry David Thoreau asked these questions almost two centuries ago. In Walden he wrote that the cost of a thing is the amount of life required to be exchanged for it, “for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to leave alone”. No wonder most people live lives of quiet desperation.

“On His Majesty’s Stretched Service” (August 30th) noted that one of the tasks facing MI6 is “catching spies working for foreign services, ideally by penetrating them”. It appears that James Bond’s methods are still relevant after all.

Mark SchofieldLondon

I wonder if the task of MI6 agents catching spies by penetrating them is as much fun as it sounds. At the very least I hope they start by taking them out to dinner.
