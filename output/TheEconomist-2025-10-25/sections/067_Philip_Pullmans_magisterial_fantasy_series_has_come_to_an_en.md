SHE IS ONE of modern literature’s great heroines. Readers first met Lyra Belacqua, a gutsy, clever 11-year-old, in “Northern Lights” (1995) as she sneaked around Jordan College, Oxford, with her best friend Roger. She embarked on a quest that spanned six books and took her to the Arctic and Smyrna, into parallel worlds and the Land of the Dead. Lyra’s otherworldly adventures have proved captivating: the “His Dark Materials” and “The Book of Dust” trilogies have sold some 50m copies worldwide and have been adapted for the stage and the screen (see pictures). But now, after 30 years, Sir Philip Pullman has announced that Lyra’s journey will come to an end with “The Rose Field”.

The series sets epic battles in a richly imagined universe. It is a polemic against organised religion in much the same way that C.S. Lewis’s “The Chronicles of Narnia” was a pro-Christian allegory. In the “Dark Materials” trilogy, Lyra and her allies travel through realms fighting the Magisterium, a religious institution bent on repression and control.

Sir Philip blends fantasy and reality throughout. Lyra’s home world has much in common with the real one. Jordan College is fictional, but Oxford is vividly described. The Magisterium is based in Geneva, a city crucial to the Protestant Reformation, but takes its name from a Catholic term for liturgical authority.

Lyra’s allies include angels, witches, talking bears and tiny humanoids. In her world, people have daemons: animal companions that represent their interior selves. Technology has a magical bent. Lyra proves an adept reader of a truth-telling machine called an alethiometer. One of her companions wields a knife that can create openings into other worlds; another invents a sort of telescope that can see “dust”, physical evidence of consciousness.

The second trilogy seemed to promise more of the same gripping stuff. The action mostly takes place in Lyra’s world. “La Belle Sauvage” (2017) begins before “His Dark Materials” and explains how Lyra came to Jordan College.

The second (“The Secret Commonwealth”, 2019) and third volumes take place afterwards, when Lyra is a young woman. She grows alienated from her daemon and parts from him—something few people in her world can do.

In “The Rose Field” Lyra and her daemon set out separately for a building in the desert said to contain a secret pertaining to dust. The Magisterium, which associates dust with original sin, seeks to find the same place for malevolent reasons. Lyra also hopes to reconnect with her daemon, rediscover her imagination and recover an intellectual openness that she had lost in late adolescence.

The “Book of Dust” trilogy has had its high points. Unfortunately this instalment’s combination of quest and bildungsroman never quite coheres into something convincing. Part of the problem is that Sir Philip has not chosen the most subtle of allegories for maturing. Many people, as they grow up, too vehemently reject childhood habits and opinions: most people correct themselves eventually. Not for nothing did Friedrich Nietzsche believe that maturity meant regaining the seriousness of a child at play.

In the first trilogy, readers cared about Lyra because she was brave, her instincts were correct and her enemies detestable. In this one, Sir Philip

depends on readers retaining that affection, but too often “The Rose Field” descends into an episodic slog.

Sir Philip seems to have grown tired of creating. At best his characters are two-dimensional; some feel pushed around for the sake of the plot rather than discovered. Lyra’s enemies can be cartoonishly odious. Often, as in the case of the book’s putative antagonist, Olivier Bonneville, they test the reader’s credulity.

In the early novels, each step revealed something about Lyra’s world. Here that world is less profuse: instead of diverse species with their own array of characters, “The Rose Field” has gryphons, all of whom are avaricious warriors. When Lyra argues with an angel—the only one in the book, who seems to appear just to have this conversation—about the nature of imagination, the reader can feel Sir Philip’s hands working their mouths. Part of Lyra’s task is to find the alkahest, a universal solvent. It gives little away to say that this is a metaphor. Anyone who has heard Sir Philip interviewed about society can probably guess what it pertains to.

The book’s main points—that life is a gift; this world is full of riches waiting to be discovered; and compassion, curiosity and kindness are the cardinal virtues—are fundamentally the same as in the first trilogy, but less artfully expressed. It is true that six long novels is a lot to draw from one well. But a lacklustre ending for such a magnificent series and its swashbuckling heroine is a bitter disappointment. ■
