“A HOUSE of Dynamite”, Kathryn Bigelow’s film about a nuclear strike on America, explores the terror and uncertainty of a nuclear crisis. An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is heading for Chicago, but no one can tell whether North Korea, China or Russia fired it. Within minutes the president is deciding whether to retaliate—picking from a menu of “rare”, “medium” and “well-done” thermonuclear options—knowing that any could lead to Armageddon. This fictional fog of nuclear war is terrifying enough. But what of the real world in which Donald Trump, a mercurial president with sole authority to

fire thousands of nukes, displays deep confusion about nuclear weapons and his national-security staff struggles to set him straight?

On October 29th Mr Trump unexpectedly announced on Truth Social that he was ordering the Pentagon to “start testing” nuclear weapons immediately. On the face of it, Mr Trump was announcing that America would resume underground nuclear explosions in Nevada for the first time since 1992. But his post was so riddled with errors and inconsistencies that perhaps, some suggested, Mr Trump was thinking not of nuclear warheads but rather the means to deliver them?

Some calculated ambiguity has always been part of deterrence, but America’s nuclear policy has never been like Mr Trump’s erratic approach to tariffs and diplomacy, where threats and bluffs can yield an advantage. In nuclear matters ambiguity can be dangerous, “when nobody knows what the president is talking about”, notes Eric Edelman, a former senior Pentagon official. It does not help that Mr Trump tossed his maybe policy as the globe is entering a new nuclear age marked by an alarming mix of deepening great-power rivalry, nuclear threats by Russia, China’s rapid build-up, pressure for more countries to go nuclear and the expiry next year of New START, a treaty that limits America’s and Russia’s long-range nuclear weapons.

Mr Trump’s social-media post was a muddle from the opening line claiming that “the United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”. The best open-source estimate, by the Federation of American Scientists, assesses that America has a stockpile of 5,177 warheads, against Russia’s 5,459. Mr Trump claimed that China “will be even within five years”, even though the Pentagon reckons it will have more like 1,000 warheads by 2030 and possibly 1,500 by 2035.

His command was the biggest headscratcher. “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. If he was thinking about warheads the accusation made no sense: the only country known to have conducted explosive tests this century is North Korea, the last time in 2017. If Mr Trump was thinking about delivery

systems, then the order was redundant: America regularly tests its ICBMs— in fact it did so this week.

National-security officials have been at a loss to explain. Admiral Richard Correll, the nominee to lead Strategic Command, in charge of fighting any nuclear war, suggested Mr Trump might have been talking about delivery systems. Chris Wright, the energy secretary in charge of warhead testing, spoke of “system tests” for new warheads with no nuclear explosion. But in an interview with CBS News, Mr Trump seemed fixated on underground explosions, insisting that other countries were conducting them and America should, too.

Mr Trump has a range of options before him. The best would be to confirm that he will not conduct explosive nuclear tests unless rivals do, but such backpedalling would be uncharacteristic. He could declare himself content with Mr Wright’s plan or with the latest test of a Minuteman II ICBM. A riskier step would be to order low-yield underground tests, though the benefit may not justify the blowback. The most dangerous would be to talk himself into full-scale explosive nuclear tests.

Most American nuclear experts, including Republican-leaning ones, argue that China has most to gain from a return to nuclear testing. That is because over the years it has conducted far fewer tests (45) than Russia (715) or America (1,030). Officials reckon they have the historical data, and the supercomputers, to model nuclear explosions and ensure the weapons are reliable. It could take years, and congressional funding, to resume full underground tests.

Two risks are apparent in Mr Trump’s nuclear fog. One is that China or Russia will seize on his ambiguity to resume nuclear testing. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s leader, ordered his staff to plan for a possible resumption of tests. A second danger is that American hardliners will now push for testing. His first administration toyed with the idea. It was endorsed last year by Mr Trump’s former national-security adviser, Robert O’Brien. Senator Tom Cotton, once regarded as a potential defence secretary, cited Mr Trump’s remarks while extolling “the obvious benefits of such testing to ensure the stockpile is fully prepared and ready” and to “send a strong message of resolve and deterrence”.

And yet, as the president in Ms Bigelow’s flawed film learns, being ready is not enough to avoid nuclear catastrophe; mistakes can be dangerous when, as he reflects, “we all built a house filled with dynamite [...] but we kept on living in it”. ■
