Letters are welcome via email to letters@economist.comFind out more about how we process your letter Shares in European companies are drawing attention from global investors, as valuation dynamics and the risk of concentration in American markets come into sharper focus. Buttonwood (September 20th) highlighted the growing appeal of Europe, particularly beyond the core markets. But the story is not only about Europe’s resilience; it is also about structural shifts in the American equity landscape.

Nearly 40% of the S&P 500’s value is now concentrated in just ten companies, leaving investors with an exposure that is broader in name than in substance. This imbalance is prompting a search for diversification and investors are increasingly looking at European firms, from industrial leaders in Italy to plucky regional banks in Greece, where valuations are more modest and market leadership more evenly distributed.

Although these companies may not scale the heights promised by a Wall Street initial public offering, they need not relocate to access American capital. A domestic listing paired with cross-trading offers a grounded path to visibility and liquidity, without abandoning home markets. Shares in Europe’s companies, long trading at a discount, are priced for rediscovery.

History repeats itself. Those who propose to “delayer” organisations by getting rid of middle managers (“Unbossing it”, October 11th) should take a look at the damage that Michael Hammer’s theories wreaked on businesses in the early 1990s. That was when middle managers were laid off by the truckload in the name of “business process re-engineering”, Hammer’s strategy for root-and-branch redesigns of companies’ operations. It did a lot of damage and the reason was profoundly simple. It is the middle managers who know how organisations really work, not the procedural manuals that say what is supposed to happen.

Regarding “Why the war on drug pricing will fail” in America (October 4th), pharmaceutical companies spend vast sums of money to create brand- name drugs that treat chronic diseases because they are more likely than other medications to gain regulatory approval, to be regularly used, and to command high prices. In contrast, inexpensive, life-saving concepts such as the cardiovascular polypill, a British invention that could prevent large numbers of heart attacks and strokes, are ignored because companies and their investors can’t reap large monetary returns.

Is early access to blockbuster drugs worth it? No. Although America spends far more per head on health care than other rich countries it dramatically underperforms them in outcomes. You are right to note that reducing waste and profit-taking by powerful middlemen could save money. But more must be done. RAND has proposed ten policies to incentivise the development and adoption of high-value, cost-lowering health-care technologies. If they were implemented, American ingenuity and free enterprise would do the rest.

It is indeed true that left-handed athletes seem to have an innate edge in some sports (“A sinister advantage”, September 27th). One example of this is the boxing match in 1966 between Muhammad Ali and Karl Mildenberger, a German and the first southpaw to fight for the world heavyweight title. The champ was frustrated by the sinister difficulty imposed by Mildenberger and the fight went to 12 rounds. Ali won by a technical knockout, but Mildenberger was able to hammer and hurt Ali’s liver area with body punches, which was remarkable given his legendary invulnerability in the midsection.

Your article on how cycling is “revolutionising transport” mentioned that Montreal is North America’s leading cycling city (“Four wheels good, two wheels better”, October 11th). You reported from there during the summer months. Large snowfalls make cycling hazardous at many other times of the year. When bike lanes are added to already narrow streets and resources are diverted to clearing them of snow instead of car lanes then traffic becomes impeded for the sake of a few diehard cyclists.

You presented the city-transport issue as a choice between bicycles and cars. Yet what if the new cyclists are not switching from cars, but are former pedestrians or public-transport users? New bike lanes come at the expense of road space, adding to congestion, and deepen the financial woes of public- transport operators faced with declining ridership.

The bicycle that I used in place of a car cost me $5,000 to own and operate. By contrast, the average cost of car ownership in the United States is about $1,000 per month, according to the AAA), which is $300,000 over 25 years, or 60 times what I spent. This matters for the economy. Widespread bicycle adoption would cause a non-cyclical contraction in GDP. In all seriousness, if we save the planet and ourselves by learning to do more with less, how do we pay down the public debts incurred under the presumption of infinite GDP growth?

One important perspective in the culture wars over bike lanes was missing from your article: cyclists who pervasively ride on sidewalks. Scarcely a week passes without a near collision with a cyclist when I walk the streets of Washington, DC. Apparently unaware that riding on the sidewalk is illegal, the police ignore it. Cyclists seem unbothered as they dangerously barrel past pedestrians. I have no ideological gripe over cycling to work or sharing the road with cyclists. If only they would stay in their lane.

Your article on the resurgence of interest in John Singer Sargent focused, like recent exhibitions, on the painter’s lavish portraits of deep-pocketed patrons (“Paint me a plutocrat”, October 4th). The fresh enthusiasm is welcome, but Sargent’s most ambitious work cannot be seen at an exhibition. It is at the Boston Public Library. There, on the high walls and ceilings of the otherwise unvisited top floor, live the sprawling, and in places gilded, murals that he laboured over until his death in 1925. They paint a portrait not of luxury, but of the chaotic history of religion, as Sargent saw it, from Astarte to the New Testament. Interspersed with graphic digressions on the horrors of war, the murals’ relevance to the present arguably outstrip the straps of “Madame X”, Sargent’s portrait of a young socialite in 1884.

Another paean to Wetherspoon, a cheap-but-cheerful British pub chain (“Orwell’s idyll”, October 11th). But what would George Orwell, who “distilled the essence of the British pub” in 1946, really have thought? Wetherspoon’s use of Orwell’s “The Moon Under Water” for the name of several of its establishments feels like a type of theft. Read the essay and go to a Spoon. You’ll see what I mean.
