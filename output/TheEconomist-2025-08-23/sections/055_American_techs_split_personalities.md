Publicly traded startups aren’t what they used to be

IF INVESTORS IN America’s technology industry had a single mind, it  
would be in the midst of a dissociative episode. The logical left brain is  
beginning to wonder if the artificial-intelligence (AI) revolution is all it is  
cracked up to be. Nuh-uh, retorts the emotional right brain.

The mind’s rational hemisphere is responsible for a wobble on August 19th  
in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. This shaved nearly 10% from the market  
capitalisation of Palantir, an AI-analytics darling worth some $370bn.  
Nvidia, the AI era’s chipmaker of choice, which last month became the first  
company in history to be worth over $4trn, saw more than $150bn in  
shareholder value evaporate. Days before, early backers of CoreWeave  
cashed in $1bn-worth of shares in the AI-data-centre operator the moment
they were allowed to following its initial public offering (IPO) in March. In  
a vote of confidence, so did one of the company’s directors. CoreWeave’s  
market value fell by over a third.

This burst of caution in public markets stands in contrast to the unrelenting  
right-brain exuberance in private ones. Venture capitalists are falling over  
themselves to back any startup with a dream and AI in its pitch. Even as  
investors were dumping Palantir shares, Databricks, which also peddles AI  
analytics, said it was raising fresh capital at a valuation of $100bn, up from  
$62bn in its previous funding round less than a year ago. The same day the  
New York Times reported that OpenAI was in talks to let current and former  
employees offload some of their stakes at a valuation of $500bn, $200bn  
more than in March—never mind that the ChatGPT-maker’s long-awaited  
new model proved ho-hum.

You should never read too much into short-term market swings. Despite the  
latest thud, public tech valuations look dizzying. Private ones are too opaque  
to draw definitive conclusions. Still, you can read a little bit. And by the  
looks of it, investors as a group are cooling in their enthusiasm for what is  
(incumbent tech stocks) while displaying a superheated zeal for what will be  
(the startups that may one day eclipse them).

The idea that the new must be better than the old is, obviously, itself nothing  
novel. Yet a look at the past few decades of American tech suggests it may  
also be increasingly ahistorical. As a group, earlier vintages of startups  
outmatch newer ones on some key measures of performance. At least that  
appears to be the case for those firms which decide to subject themselves to  
the scrutiny of public markets.

Jay Ritter of the University of Florida maintains perhaps the most  
comprehensive database out there of American IPOs, going back to 1980. At  
Schumpeter’s request, he crunched the numbers for four IPO cohorts. Call  
them, loosely, pre-dotcom (1990-98), dotcom (1999-2000), web 2.0 (2001-  
11) and new web (2012-23).

The first thing to note is that startups of yore were readier to go public than  
today’s lot. More than 1,200 listed their shares between 1990 and 1998.  
Another 631 piled in amid the dotcom mania, when basically all you needed
for a listing was a domain name. The web 2.0 and new-web generations  
added just 381 and 485, respectively. As much as your Gen-X columnist  
would love to blame this on Millennial and Gen-Z founders’ congenital  
incapacity to endure the harsh discipline of a stockmarket listing, it probably  
has more to do with the growth of venture capital. This lets startups stay  
private for longer, which also explains why the typical age at which firms  
list has risen, from eight years among the pre-dotcoms to 11 for the new-  
webbers. (On this and subsequent measures, the dotcom folly led to such  
outlier results that it makes sense to exclude them for the analysis.)

Being older, the more recent vintages were also bigger. The typical new-  
webber went public having generated $191m in the previous 12 months, four  
times the figure for its pre-dotcom forebear after adjusting for inflation. A  
rougher analysis than Mr Ritter’s of the 1,000 biggest tech firms in the  
Nasdaq implies that post-IPO sales also grew more slowly from this higher  
base. Newer vintages are also likelier to be lossmaking. Whereas 60% of the  
pre-dotcoms were making money when they listed their shares, the same is  
true of just 24% of new-webbers. The web 2.0 group sat in between, with  
40% being profitable.

One consequence of being worse at making money is being better at going  
belly-up. Less than 6% of the pre-dotcoms found themselves in distress  
within three years of IPO (which Mr Ritter defines as a 90% decline relative  
to the offer price or a delisting). This rises to 7% for web 2.0 and 11% for  
the new web. Admittedly, things even out five years after a listing: 14% of  
the pre-dotcoms and 12% of the new-webbers were in trouble by then. But  
other things being equal, you would expect the share to be higher for the  
earlier vintages, which had less time to test their business models.

And still, investors’ novelty fetish seems intact. The average new-web firm  
outperformed the market in terms of shareholder returns (including  
dividends) by a cumulative 52 percentage points over its first five years as a  
public company, according to Mr Ritter’s sums. The pre-dotcoms and web  
2.0 managed 41 and 15 points, respectively. For web 2.0 and especially the  
new web, this outperformance was driven by larger startups; those with pre-  
IPO sales below $100m barely beat the benchmark.
Investors are, in other words, rewarding newness and bigness rather than  
quality. Mr Ritter finds virtually no difference between the returns afforded  
to profitable and unprofitable tech businesses in the years after their IPOs. If  
startups with sounder fundamentals cannot count on outsized gains in the  
stockmarket, more may opt to stay private. The result could be a cycle of  
adverse selection. Something for the left brain to ponder. ■
