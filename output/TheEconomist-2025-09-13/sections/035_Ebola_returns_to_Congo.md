Driving medicines from Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, to the south-central province of Kasai takes almost three days. That is bad news for people there who have recently been diagnosed with Ebola, a severe virus that kills some 50-90% of those infected in a matter of days. Yet the remote location of the province, far from the Congo river, the central African country’s main artery, should also help contain the outbreak. It marks the 16th time Ebola has been confirmed in Congo since it was discovered there in 1976. So far the outbreak in Kasai, which was confirmed by the UN’s World Health Organisation (WHO) on September 4th, has killed 16 people, four of them health workers, and infected dozens of others. The toll is likely to rise,

especially because there was a lag between the first death on August 25th and confirmation that Ebola was to blame. Since people can contract the disease through contact with the bodies of victims, quickly isolating the sick and safely disposing of the dead is vital.

For now, experts are reasonably optimistic they can stop the spread. There are several reasons for that, besides the remote location of the outbreak. Initial assessments of the fatality rate are relatively low, with just over half of known patients succumbing even before clinics have been set up. In the early stages of previous outbreaks, nearly all those who fell ill died.

Congo’s experience with Ebola means it has improved its response with every new outbreak. Besides better logistics and medical capacity, it now has access to new antibody treatments that can reverse the disease’s progress and help with recovery. Unlike other parts of Congo, Kasai is not currently a site of major armed conflict.

Last but not least, there is now an effective vaccine. It was unavailable a decade ago, when Ebola killed more than 11,000 people during an outbreak in west Africa, and was still in its experimental stages when thousands more died of the disease in Congo in 2018 and 2019. Now the WHO is ferrying 2,000 doses of the vaccine from Kinshasa to Kasai, along with medical specialists, protective equipment and $2m from its emergency fund.

Yet there are also reasons to worry. Despite improved Ebola care, Congo’s health system is overburdened and underfunded. The government is already struggling to stem outbreaks of mpox and cholera in other parts of the country. Kasai’s nearest isolation centre has just 15 beds, hardly enough to tackle a large outbreak. It is also the first time Congo has had to fight an Ebola outbreak without American help. “We really used to rely on the US,” says Dr Patrick Otim, an epidemiologist who manages the WHO’s Ebola response. In the past, the US Agency for International Development used to help with investigations into the virus and provide mobile labs and planes to get experts and equipment to remote areas. Now Dr Otim and his colleagues will need to find that support elsewhere, which takes time.

Even if the current outbreak is successfully contained, Ebola will probably return to Congo. Fruit bats, the most likely carriers of the virus, are drawn to

its thick forests, meaning Ebola circulates among wild animals there. Plenty of Congolese rely on the forests for their livelihood, eating the animals’ meat or encountering them while farming or cutting timber.

The hope is that better monitoring, along with the vaccine and improved treatment options, will make each new outbreak in Congo less menacing than the one before. A previous outbreak, in 2022, was contained within three months, when it had killed just a handful of people. With a bit of luck, the current one will not be much more lethal. ■
