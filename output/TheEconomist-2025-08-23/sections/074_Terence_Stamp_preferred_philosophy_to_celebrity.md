As he stood on his mark, sunshine fell softly on his blond curls. Around him,  
beyond the deck of HMS Avenger, the waves sparkled. Beside him, in a  
slight breeze, the noose swayed. Sometimes it touched his face. Mutinous  
sailors thronged the lower deck, watching. He, Billy Budd, a saintly young  
crewman, was about to be unjustly hanged. And he was at peace, the script  
said.

How could he play a scene like that? He struggled to remember what  
Anthony Newley, another working-class actor like him, had told him. Empty  
head. Get rid of all the thoughts. He couldn’t do it; they kept coming. But  
then, suddenly, a song popped up from nowhere: “Little Dolly Daydream,  
pride of Idaho...” and he was full of another feeling. Lying on a rug in front
of a coal fire at his Granny Kate’s house in Barking Road, doing his  
homework, while out in the scullery she would be making him a marmalade  
sandwich and singing. This was a feeling beyond thinking, a strange  
otherness, and at the premiere of “Billy Budd” in 1962, it left not a dry eye  
in the house. He had nailed it in one take.

That film shot Terence Stamp to fame, winning him at 24 an Oscar  
nomination. After that it was a film a year: “The Collector” (a psychopathic  
butterfly collector pinning down Samantha Eggar), “Modesty Blaise” (a  
Cockney sidekick to a comic-book heroine), “Far From the Madding  
Crowd” (arch-cad Sergeant Troy ensnaring Bathsheba), “Poor Cow” (a bank  
robber with a tender side). He became one of the icons of the 1960s, all wide  
eyes and good cheekbones, and one of the voices too, confidently Cockney.  
His girlfriends were Jean Shrimpton and Julie Christie, both epitomes of  
class and style. David Bailey photographed him. He filmed in America,  
smoking peyote and a lot of Acapulco Gold. He worked with William Wyler  
and John Schlesinger. Best of all, in 1968 Federico Fellini chose him as his  
leading man.

It was all a bit surprising really. He didn’t actually think he looked that good.  
Clothes were fun, and he had always been mad about them, dragging his  
mum all over the market looking for the right jacket, dreaming of custom-  
made shoes. But his face? “The most beautiful man in the world” was  
mostly the creation of the lighting designer on “Billy Budd”, Robert  
Krasker, who had lit “The Third Man”. Film could do that. And this was  
something he had known ever since he was three, sitting with his mum in the  
one-and-ninepenny seats at the Old Grand and watching Gary Cooper play  
Beau Geste: cinema was magic.

People often thought there was something magical about him, too. Or, at  
least, intensely strange. Or mesmerising, like the terrifying sabre-whirling  
display he put on for Julie Christie in “Far From the Madding Crowd”. (All  
the scarier because he, a leftie, was made to do them right-handed.)  
Brooding silences were also his speciality. The thing was, he was fascinated  
by acting and how it was done well. In “Billy Budd” he had sent his feelings  
directly to the audience without needing words. Their minds had met in a  
sort of empty but conscious space. And what this had seemed to require  
from him was to be absolutely present in the moment. Not observing his
thoughts, not worrying about direction, but giving his purest self to the  
audience and bringing out the best in them.

As an acting method, though, it was hard to achieve. He began to consider it  
seriously when in 1968 he met Jiddu Krishnamurti in Rome and went for a  
walk with him. Krishnamurti would keep interrupting their chat to point out  
a tree, or a cloud. To an East End spiv like him, that seemed weird. Later he  
realised that if he had not noticed them too, it was because he was not yet  
fully in the moment. That was what he had to work on. His longest attempt  
so far, in Pier Paolo Pasolini’s “Teorema” (1968), was to play a divine  
stranger who seduced an entire family as pure consciousness and energy.  
Because he had no lines, he simply was.

In 1970 he went off to India, less to study than because, in a new decade,  
directors wanted a younger face than his. Over seven years in an ashram in  
Poona, in orange robes and on a macrobiotic diet, he took up yoga and  
meditation and picked up advice on breathing from Sufis he met. Yet a cable  
mentioning a role in Superman, and the chance of working with Marlon  
Brando, got him home and in the part in a trice, robes, beard and all. He  
needed no preparation. He was awake now, and thought, I’ll just go with  
that.

The Superman films epitomised it. They not only revived his career in a new  
age; they also gave him the chance to play an arch-villain, General Zod, not  
as cartoon evil but as all-enveloping presence. In “Superman II” (1980), as  
he commanded America’s president to “Kneel before Zod!” in the Oval  
Office, he was so purely aware that he felt he had a Magnum strapped to his  
leg. The same “cognisant emptiness” lay behind the desperate anger of a  
vengeful father in “The Limey” (1999) and the serenity of trans Bernadette  
in “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert” (1994), instructing a  
hostile bar-manager to blow her own box apart in the same level tone as she  
had ordered a lime daiquiri.

By that time, he was in full awareness automatically between “Action!” and  
“Cut!” This meant he was unafraid to tackle any role, including, in  
“Priscilla”, that of a woman in the wrong body (and dance it too, in crude  
lipstick and a lion’s mane of a wig). Outside filming it was back to his  
dapper Cockney self, still with the accent of Bow via Plaistow flavouring his
talk, still with the great bone structure, favouring black homburgs and pink  
linen suits and living in the Albany while worrying about his bus fare. He  
kept meditation, yoga and macrobiotics going. A macrobiotic diet made you  
stay beautiful for ever.

Celebrity hadn’t really marked him. He’d mostly enjoyed it. You could say  
his whole career had come from, and gone back to, that moment when he  
had stood on HMS Avenger with the sun playing on his peroxide curls, and  
realised there was nothing in his head but a tender little ditty last heard in  
Barking Road, E13. ■
