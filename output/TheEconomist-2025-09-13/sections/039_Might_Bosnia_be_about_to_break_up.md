The citizens of Bosnia—Bosnia and Herzegovina, to give it its correct full name—would like to know when a president is not a president. On August 6th the country’s Central Election Commission stripped Milorad Dodik of the presidency of the Serbian autonomous half of the country, known as the Republika Srpska (RS), a decision that has since been upheld on appeal. Yet Mr Dodik refuses to accept this. Thirty years after the end of the Bosnian war, the country lurches from crisis to crisis. But even by Bosnian standards, this one looks exceptionally grave. Bosnia’s post-war settlement saw it comprised of two autonomous “entities” and a weak central government. But, left over from the agreement, there is also a foreign-appointed “High Representative” who has a lot of power,

should he choose to exercise it. More than a thousand troops from an EU-led force, mandated by the UN Security Council, are also stationed in the country to help with security.

One of the entities is home mostly to Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) and Croats. The other, the RS, is home mostly to Serbs. Mr Dodik, who first came to power in 1998, has long flip-flopped between saying he wants independence for his statelet or instead a return to the basics of the original peace deal of 1996, which would mean the central government having even less power than it does today.

The election commission’s action came in the wake of Mr Dodik’s conviction and ban on holding public office for six years, for flouting rulings by Christian Schmidt, the (German) High Representative. Backed by Russia and China, Mr Dodik says that Mr Schmidt’s appointment was illegal and that he does not recognise his authority. Despite this, Mr Dodik paid a fine to avoid jail. He is now appealing to the Constitutional Court in a bid to overturn his conviction. He is doing this to eventually take his case to the European Court of Human Rights. This is ironic, given that the original dispute began after the RS passed legislation stating that the Constitutional Court no longer had jurisdiction in its half of the country.

Mr Dodik has called a referendum for October 25th asking whether RS citizens accept his removal from office. Already under American sanctions, Mr Dodik has been courting the administration of Donald Trump, so far to no avail. He visited Moscow on September 9th to ask for Russian support. The country is “occupied” and “the last colony in Europe”, he says. Opposition parties in the RS are weak and divided, and anyone who dares run in the new presidential election set for November 23rd will be branded a traitor.

Milos Solaja, an analyst in Banja Luka, the RS capital, says few Serbs will vote in the election but that it is “very, very likely” that Mr Dodik will win his referendum. He warns, however, that this is a moment of “absolute uncertainty”. What could happen is that Bosniaks and Croats who live in the RS will turn out to elect, in the absence of many Serb votes, a candidate who will be recognised by them and by Western countries, but not by most people in the RS. After this, says Mr Dodik, “the conditions will be created for holding a definitive referendum on independence. And I think this is an unstoppable path.”

Depending on how much support Mr Dodik can garner in the coming weeks, domestically and abroad, he will have to make a decision on whether to quietly step back or go for broke, with all the risks that breaking up Bosnia could entail. ■
