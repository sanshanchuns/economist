Eight months after taking office, Donald Trump has blocked an astonishing amount of the cash America once sent abroad. In April officials had barely shut down USAID, America’s biggest foreign-aid agency, when they froze the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which was set up by George W. Bush to build infrastructure in poor countries. From the Global Engagement Centre (established by Barack Obama to support pro-democracy activists) to the Agency for Global Media (by Bill Clinton to fund foreign reporters), the institutions founded by presidents to do good abroad mostly no longer exist. Apart from one tiny agency, that is. The International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which lends to foreign companies rather than governments, is the last institution standing. Its loan book was a quarter of

the size of USAID’s outlays last year, but Mr Trump wants it to grow while ditching its focus on the poor world and instead lending to rich countries, including America. That would transform the bank into one part of the sovereign-wealth fund Mr Trump has promised to create.

The DFC dates back to Mr Trump’s first term in the White House. He established it to lend to companies in poor countries at market rates. Since then, it has invested $50bn, in loans and equity stakes, in everything from mining in Africa to telecoms in Asia. It also sells insurance against corruption, terrorism and war. Its 700-odd staff are mostly commercial lawyers and financial analysts, rather than aid bureaucrats or development economists.

They work in a manner that fits with Mr Trump’s preference for transactional diplomacy. Unlike aid organisations, which dole out cheap loans and grants, the bank picks projects likely to turn a profit, and seeks to support industries where America lags behind China, encouraging alternative supply in allied countries. Its profits are collected by the federal government.

At the same time, the idea so far has been to help developing countries, which tend to lack private investment. A small financial package from America could, in theory, encourage much bigger private investments, which is why the bank lends only in concert with other financiers.

Now Mr Trump is rethinking its approach. In March he issued an executive order instructing the DFC to ramp up American critical-mineral production, even though the bank is banned from lending at home. Officials are looking at other ways they could support Mr Trump’s domestic priorities, perhaps even by building factories. One says that he has been asked to consider projects in Greenland. And then there is the desire to expand the range of countries to which the bank can lend. The White House says the DFC’s focus will be on improving national security.

Mr Trump is seeking to appoint a new boss to run the organisation: Ben Black, a financier whose father was one of the founders of Apollo, a giant asset manager. He wants to take more risk. The White House also hopes to increase the bank’s firepower by raising the ceiling on its total lending from

$60bn to $250bn. Should the DFC continue to lend at roughly a fifth of its cap, that could take disbursements to $50bn a year, or a few billion more than USAID’s outlay before it was scrapped.

Every seven years lawmakers must extend the organisation’s life—a deadline due on October 6th. The White House hopes Congress will approve its transformation at the same time. So far, though, legislators have shown little enthusiasm. Democrats and Republicans alike were shocked by the speed with which Mr Trump dismantled America’s aid system. Some are unwilling to give up a bargaining chip. A short-term extension may see the bank’s future incorporated into talks around the next budget. At that point lawmakers could face an invidious choice: would they prefer aid done Mr Trump’s way or no development assistance at all? ■
