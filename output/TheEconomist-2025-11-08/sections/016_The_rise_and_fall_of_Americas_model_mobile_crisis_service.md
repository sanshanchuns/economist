DURING A New York mayoral debate in October the front-runner, Zohran Mamdani, said CAHOOTS, “a programme in Eugene, Oregon”, could be a model for how New York handles mental-health crises without using police. Many in Eugene were perplexed as, after 36 years, CAHOOTS ended all services in the city on April 7th. Its demise is a strange tale mixing hippies, policing, mental illness and plain mismanagement. CAHOOTS is supposed to work as follows. When she was 15, Rebecca Hill ingested a large number of pills in a suicide attempt. A worker drove her home from the hospital so that her parents did not find out. “I was scared,

and CAHOOTS was there for me when no other grown-ups were,” she says. More than a decade later, Hill was preparing to jump off a parking deck when a stranger asked if she needed any help. “Not unless you’re going to push me,” Ms Hill replied. Instead, the stranger called CAHOOTS, who talked with Ms Hill for an hour before driving her to a treatment centre. “My life was saved by the kindness and calmness that CAHOOTS workers showed to me,” she says.

A handful of researchers at the University of Oregon, also in Eugene, have crunched 911 call data to quantify the programme’s value. Professor Rori Rohlfs estimated that, because of CAHOOTS, police were dispatched to 23% fewer calls. Jonathan Davis, another Oregon professor, co-wrote a paper showing that CAHOOTS reduced the probability that a 911 call ends in an arrest by 76%. Each arrest costs taxpayers, so the service provided significant savings. “CAHOOTS is a low-cost way to expand the police force,” says Mr Davis.

It did not begin like that. In 1969 a handful of anarchist hippies founded the White Bird Clinic, which offered free mental-health services to all. “It was a classic Eugenian, anti-establishment, anti-authoritarian, throw-the-rules-out- the-window” solution, said Justin Madeira, now head of CAHOOTS. For the first two decades, White Bird worked informally with the police, who frequently dropped off people having bad acid trips at the clinic.

Despite concerns on both sides, the Eugene police and White Bird formalised their co-operation in 1989, creating CAHOOTS, a service where idealistic medics assisted the police on 911 calls. Officially, CAHOOTS stands for “Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets,” but it is also an acknowledgment that hippies were uneasy working so closely with cops.

Yet, on the ground, signs of tension are few. “I absolutely love working with them,” Mr Madeira says. The police feel similarly. In Springfield, Eugene’s sister city, CAHOOTS continues to operate. “You can ask any of our officers, and they would all say that the value CAHOOTS brings is something the city should continue to prioritise,” says Lieutenant Justin Myers of the Springfield Police. Eugene police provided 40% of the funding for CAHOOTS to have 50 employees and four vans roaming the city, offering services 24 hours a day.

Then came national attention and the beginning of the end. In January 2021 the Daily Show described CAHOOTS as a “trial run” for defunding the police. Portland and Denver created services modelled on it. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon introduced the CAHOOTS Act in Congress.

But CAHOOTS was not ready for the CAHOOTS Act. The programme could bill Medicaid only if it collected data to measure effectiveness. Afraid that this would lessen trust among its many homeless clients, CAHOOTS resisted the new stipulations and missed out.  White Bird also underwent internal turmoil. The freewheeling organisation attempted to embrace the org chart. In 2022 workers unionised.

Then, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court in January this year, one CAHOOTS medic alleged she was raped and later slapped by a co-worker. In February White Bird lost its director, and, in October, it settled the lawsuit for $600,000. As New York is considering creating its own mobile crisis service, is there any chance that the original will be able to return to its hometown? “We remain open to the idea,” says Mr Madeira. ■
