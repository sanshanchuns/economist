It is the scandal that will never die.  For more than six years the case of Jeffrey Epstein, a dead sex offender with links to the president and other prominent figures, has spawned a dizzying array of conspiracy theories. On November 18th American lawmakers passed a law compelling the government to release its files on Epstein. The bill has been signed by the president. Yet what exactly are the Epstein files, and what can the public expect to see? The largest batch is held by the Department of Justice (DoJ) and encompasses two criminal investigations that unfolded between 2006 and 2019. The first involved charges that Epstein abused dozens of underage girls in Florida. That case led to a controversial plea deal in 2008. Other DoJ

files accumulated during a second investigation that did result in a trafficking charge in July 2019. The department also holds information about Epstein’s apparent suicide the following month while in federal custody.

Federal agents amassed documents from property seizures as well as detailed witness interviews.  A July memo from the DoJ noted that it had some 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence, which included a large volume of images and videos of Epstein’s victims. The files also contain reams of internal DoJ communications.

Yet the narrow focus of the criminal investigations may disappoint those expecting damning new revelations about Epstein’s associates. “What’s crucial [in these cases] is what happened to the women, and not what people happen to be connected to Epstein,” says Jeremy Paul, a law professor at Northeastern University.

If the DoJ files are released, information about Epstein’s victims is likely to be extensively redacted. The DoJ can also withhold any documents that could jeopardise ongoing investigations. (Mr Trump recently ordered the department to investigate prominent Democrats associated with Epstein.) For those podcasters and politicians who believe withholding documents is evidence of conspiracy, there will be plenty to talk about. ■
