At first, few were worried about the rains around Taishitun, a scrabbly town in the mountains north of Beijing, in the last days of July. There had not been a flood there since 1890—and that was not a severe one. But over a few hours in the morning of July 28th, torrential downpours caused a nearby river to burst its banks. A two-metre-high torrent of water poured into the town’s nursing home. Of nearly 70 elderly residents there at the time, 31 died. Rescuers in the arid northern parts of China are more prepared for earthquakes than floods: the home had not been included in any evacuation plans. When The Economist visited Taishitun in September, brown mud still streaked many of its buildings at head height; windows smashed by the

waters gaped open onto the streets. A police car arrived within minutes, followed by a local-government official who said reporting on the flood was “sensitive”. But she also voiced a concern shared by more and more of China’s people. “Everyone feels it. Summers are hotter, winters are dryer. We respect nature. But how can an individual deal with the problems of the whole atmosphere?”

China’s Communist Party used to have a clear response to such questions: less respect for nature and no truck with individualism. Individuals should concentrate on their role in the collective effort by which “Man must conquer nature”, as one of the Maoist slogans of the Great Leap Forward had it. If mountains were in the wrong place, move them; bend rivers to the people’s will. Such attitudes resulted in a human catastrophe which was also an environmental disaster.

Later leaders maintained some interest in technological mastery, initiating fluvial megaprojects such as the Three Gorges Dam and, downstream of it, the South-North Water Diversion Project, which will eventually drain off half-a-Rhine’s-worth of the Yangzi for the benefit of distant farmers. But in general the environment was downgraded from adversary to irrelevance. The country’s water, soil and air became sumps for the residues of industrial development.

By the 1990s the paramount pursuit of economic growth, widespread corruption and lax enforcement of regulations meant that around 70% of China’s rivers and lakes were polluted or heavily polluted. Nine of the world’s ten most polluted cities were in China, according to the World Resources Institute. Much of China’s arable land was degraded due to erosion and the build-up of salt and contaminants.

Many of these problems were exposed by activists, some of whom founded campaigning organisations. The authorities tolerated such activities (while closely monitoring them) as a way to channel public discontent without threatening party rule. Some central-government officials, increasingly concerned about environmental degradation, saw such activists as a way to expose those responsible.

Outside pressure had its effects, too. In the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the United Nations Environmental Programme warned Chinese organisers—overseen by then-vice-president Xi Jinping—that some athletes might refuse to take part if it did not clean up its water and air. China spent some $17bn on environmental measures—many short-lived—such as closing or relocating factories and introducing new emission standards for vehicles.

Shortly after the air pollution made its post-games return, there was a new source of pressure: @BeijingAir, an account on what-was-then Twitter which posted air-quality measurements made at America’s embassy. Though Twitter was blocked within China, the data easily found their way into the Chinese bits of the internet, less shut off then than now. Prominent Chinese social-media users demanded action.

Action they got. Air quality in Chinese cities has improved remarkably. The improvements are sound policy; cleaner air is saving hundreds of thousands of lives. They can also be taken as evidence that the government listens to what people are worried about—even when the organised voicing of such worries is crushed, as it has been under Mr Xi.

A willingness to act on specific issues did not mean the state was embracing more general concerns about climate change. Mr Xi’s government feared recognising a link between freak weather and global change might make people uncomfortable with the country’s rapid and fossil-fuel-led economic growth. In 2019, when deadly summer floods hit central China, state media were loth to put them into the context of climate change—environmentalists seeking to do so in interviews found that their comments were never used.

In past years that has been changing. Climate change is hard to ignore when, as the official in Taishitun says, “everyone feels it”. The July rains around Beijing were part of a longer-term trend affecting much of China. Its average annual precipitation barely changed between 1901 and 1960; it has increased by 6mm per decade since then, according to the 2025 edition of an annual “blue book” on climate change published by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). “Extreme heavy precipitation” events have become more frequent.

Things are hotter as well as wetter. The CMA says that between 1961 and 2024 China’s average temperature rose at a rate of 0.31°C per decade. Many Chinese were particularly alarmed by a 70-day heatwave across southern and eastern China in 2022. It caused power shortages—air conditioners are far more common in China than they were, shifting peak loads to summer months—as well as crop failures and significant strain on infrastructure and public health. And every year since 2022 has set a new national record.

Food security, long an obsession of China’s leaders, is also increasingly under threat. Mr Xi wants the country to become more self-sufficient in its food supplies, partly to reduce its vulnerability to foreign pressure in the event of a war over Taiwan. Research funded by the agriculture ministry shows that droughts—which can increase at the same time as annual rainfall, such being the perversity of the climate—could reduce yields of maize, wheat and rice by 8% by 2030. Heavy rainfall could have a similar effect. Extreme heat will make pigs, cows and chickens less productive (it has the same effect on humans).

Reducing global emissions limits the long-term worst of this. In the shorter term, there is adaptation. In 2022 China released its first comprehensive plan for climate adaptation in the years leading up to 2035. The plan said bluntly that “Climate change will pose more and more risks to the PRC’s economic and social development, as well as the security of its people.”

China does not publish official figures for its spending on climate adaptation. But the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation told The Economist that its programmes would focus on measures such as building early-warning systems, expanding a “climate-resilient cities” scheme and enhancing disaster insurance and other financial tools. It was also unusually frank in acknowledging the challenges. Grassroots capacity for climate adaptation was “generally weak” and some regions lacked “professional expertise”, it said. In some cities policies and funding were inadequate.

This new emphasis mirrors a shift in public opinion. In 2010, only around 6% of respondents in a national survey considered climate change the country’s most urgent environmental problem. A paper by Chinese and

American scholars recently published in Nature found that by 2023 the share was more than 23%.

A study by researchers in Oxford in the same journal asked people in 125 countries whether they would be willing to contribute 1% of their income to fighting climate change. The share saying yes in China—81%—was among the highest. Asked whether they thought other people would be willing to make the same commitment the Chinese thought a heartening 56% would be. No country in Europe or North America put the share above 50%. In the United States, where 48% said they were themselves willing to contribute, just 33% expected the same of their fellow Americans.

The fact that the Chinese people want action does not mean they will get it. But their co-opted concerns have been a factor in past Chinese environmental progress. They may be again. An opportunity to please the people while taking the place on the world stage which those people consider their country’s due does not come to many leaders outside times of war.

And, outside times of war, no economy has ever turned its power so effectively to a particular real-world goal. America’s Apollo programme pushed a specific set of technologies faster and harder; but having done its job, it was shut down. The factories and supply chains providing a terawatt of clean solar and wind capacity every year are something else entirely. The brute, massive fact of them may well be as important to understanding the world in the decades to come as the nuclear arsenals of the superpowers.

Bruno Maçães, a Portuguese political scientist, argues that those nuclear arsenals are a special case of a more general characteristic: that what marks out a superpower is the ability to shape global narratives through national action. On that basis, China is clearly a climate superpower. And with America doubling down on fossil fuels, it is arguably the only one.

That does not mean it can singlehandedly create a path to salvation. The world is far too complex in its workings and disparate in its beliefs for even the most altruistic of actors to achieve such a thing, and China is far from altruistic. Besides, the hour is late. Too many harms of too many types are

already either here or imminent. But China has much to offer, and much to gain. It is a fateful opportunity■
