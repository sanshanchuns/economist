Like the European Union, Latin America—or at least most of it—is a region of democracy, committed to multilateralism and international law. The two share ties of history, language, culture and trade. And yet the United States and China loom larger than Europe in Latin America and the Caribbean. Now that both regions have felt the rough edge of Donald Trump’s hand in the form of tariffs and other threats, they are making greater efforts to draw closer. On November 9th and 10th the EU will meet the 33 countries that make up the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) in a summit in the Colombian city of Santa Marta. And in coming weeks the Council of the EU and the European Parliament look likely to ratify a trade deal with Mercosur, a free-trade bloc centred on Argentina and Brazil.

The second development is more momentous than the first, for two reasons. The summit’s timing and location have turned out to be inauspicious: many leaders from both regions now seem likely to stay away to avoid becoming entangled in Mr Trump’s pressure campaign against Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro and his sanctions on Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, the summit’s host, both of whom he accuses of involvement in drug-trafficking (which they deny). On the other hand, the trade agreement has been more than a quarter of a century in the making. In September the European Commission at last sent the text to the council, where it will be discussed by trade ministers from the 27 member states. Officials in Brussels are now optimistic that the national capitals and the parliament will approve the deal, paving the way for it to come into force by mid-2026.

The agreement has been slowed by protectionist lobbies on both sides of the Atlantic, and especially by European farmers who fear South American agri- business. But two things have changed. First, the commission has adopted new guidelines to compensate farmers for any losses, and made a bigger effort to inform them of the safeguards in the agreement. Second, the Ukraine war, trade tensions with China and the return of Mr Trump have underlined the need for the EU to diversify its alliances. “If not Mercosur, who do you diversify with?” asks a diplomat in Brussels.

These arguments have gained ground. “A year ago, the council was divided,” says a commission official. “Now the situation is more blurred.” Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain back the deal. Austria, France, Ireland and Poland have opposed it. In the end all except Poland may come round. And while there is opposition in the parliament, few expect its rejection there.

The full partnership agreement with Mercosur, which includes clauses on political co-operation, requires approval by 42 national and regional parliaments in Europe. But the trade part has been split off into an interim agreement which the council need pass only by a qualified majority of EU governments. It solidifies and expands an existing commercial relationship worth about $150bn a year. The deal removes tariffs on around 90% of trade in goods on both sides, though mostly spread over 12 years. In a study published in July the commission calculates that the agreement will boost EU exports by €49bn ($56bn) and those of Mercosur by €9bn.

European officials think the accord will halt China’s encroachment on Europe’s market share in Mercosur (which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay). For Mercosur, it is a breakthrough for a bloc that has remained fairly closed to the outside world. Brazil’s president, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, likes to stress Brazil’s membership of the BRICS grouping with China, Russia and India, among others. The EU agreement “gives Brazil an alternative to the BRICS”, says Matias Spektor of the Fundação Getulio Vargas, a university. Brazil will use it to promote a national brand tarnished in some quarters by association with Vladimir Putin, he adds. For Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, who owed his election victory last month in part to Mr Trump’s financial support, agreement might make it harder for him to carry out his occasional threats to leave Mercosur.

The EU already has trade agreements with Chile, most Andean countries, Central America and the Caribbean Community, and has negotiated an update to one with Mexico. Sergio Díaz-Granados of CAF, a regional development bank, thinks the Mercosur agreement can strengthen region- wide value chains by harmonising rules of origin. That might eventually add more substance to Europe’s ties with Latin America as a whole.

The relationship needs that. The Santa Marta summit, which is now likely to be attended mainly by ministers rather than leaders, will see worthy discussions on climate, digitalisation, and the fight against organised crime. It will also cover Global Gateway, the EU’s infrastructure-financing programme, which has €45bn earmarked for Latin America. Projects under way include fighting sargasso weed in the Caribbean and boosting satellite- internet connectivity. These make less of a splash in the region than China’s investments in ports and electricity grids.

Diplomats say the main value of the Santa Marta get-together is that it is happening at all. Far from an instrument of integration, CELAC is an advertisement for Latin America’s divisions, which have deepened with the election of more extreme leaders of both right and left. Latin American disagreement over Venezuela’s dictatorship meant that summits with the EU, conceived as biennial, did not happen between 2015 and 2023. It took a concerted effort by Spain, which held the EU’s rotating presidency, and Josep Borrell, the Spanish former EU high representative for external affairs, to revive them.

In 2023 Nicaragua, another dictatorship, refused to sign a joint declaration because of a (watered-down) condemnation of Russia’s war against Ukraine. This time there are further complications. Mr Trump’s naval build-up in the Caribbean, sinking of drug boats and threats of military action to topple Mr Maduro’s regime divide Latin America. Mr Petro is a volatile character and his foreign minister has no diplomatic experience. What might emerge from Santa Marta is a plan to hold annual ministerial meetings, while the EU is likely in practice to prioritise bilateral ties with bigger countries such as Brazil and Mexico. But whatever the difficulties, it is a relationship worth deepening. ■
