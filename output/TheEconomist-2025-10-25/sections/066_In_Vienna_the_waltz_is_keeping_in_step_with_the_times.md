Once a year the Vienna State Opera hosts a lavish ball. When you enter the magnificent auditorium, you feel as though you have stepped back in time: champagne flows as hundreds of women in gowns and men in tailcoats sweep across the floor. No one leaves without dancing a waltz, usually one composed by Johann Strauss II, the “Waltz King”. On October 25th Vienna will celebrate Strauss’s 200th birthday with a ceremony and performances. He was probably the closest thing 19th-century Austria had to a pop star: he produced operas, ballets and symphonic works, but is best remembered for his waltzes (he wrote more than 150). The Viennese waltz began as a simple peasant dance; Strauss gave it an

aristocratic air. The city’s winter balls recapture a sense of ritual and elegance.

All these years later, the waltz is flourishing. Along with Wiener schnitzel and psychoanalysis, it is one of Vienna’s most prized cultural exports. (In 2017 UNESCO added the Viennese waltz to Austria’s list of intangible cultural heritage.) The lilting melody of Strauss’s “The Blue Danube” remains one of the most recognisable tunes in the world and has been featured in television shows from “The Simpsons” to “Squid Game”. Pop stars such as Alicia Keys have borrowed the waltz’s simple triple metre. And millions tune in to watch celebrities master the Viennese waltz on shows such as “Strictly Come Dancing” and “Dancing with the Stars”.

Part of the reason for its longevity is its clarity. Easy-to-follow, repetitive melodies and a strong emphasis on the first beat make the music easy to dance to. That is probably why the waltz remains a popular choice for newlyweds’ first dance (though the Viennese version is fast and requires continuous turns). “When you see the simplicity of a beautiful waltz, it takes your breath away,” says Jason Gilkison, the creative director of “Strictly Come Dancing”. “It’s like a hot knife through butter.”

Vienna has played a key role in keeping the waltz tradition alive. The Vienna Philharmonic performs Strauss’s waltzes every New Year’s Day: tickets for the concert, allocated by lottery, can cost up to €1,200 ($1,400). Children learn to dance the waltz at studios across the city. Locals and tourists alike can attend one of the more than 400 balls that are hosted each year. Standard admission to the Vienna Opera Ball, considered the most prestigious, costs more than €400, and yet demand for tickets has soared in recent years.

Some waltz-lovers are doing away with the strict dress codes in favour of something more laidback and modern. New events have been added to the roster in recent years, such as the Rainbow Ball for LGBT+ people. “The youngsters are crazy for it,” avers Norbert Kettner, chief executive of Vienna’s tourism board. For people seeking a connection, waltzing is “a glamorous alternative to dating apps”. On a recent Friday night, young people in dresses and jeans gathered at a rooftop bar to drink cocktails and chat. As they swayed to Strauss’s waltzes, played by a string quartet, perhaps some wished finding the one was as easy as one-two-three. ■
