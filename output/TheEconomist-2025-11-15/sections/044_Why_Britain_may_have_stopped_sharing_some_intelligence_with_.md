FOR TWO months America has been killing people in the Caribbean and the Pacific by blowing up boats which, the administration says, are being used for smuggling drugs. Some experts think the strikes are illegal. Britain has had enough. Some weeks ago it suspended intelligence-sharing with America on drug-trafficking in the area, according to American and British news reports. That would mark a rupture to an intelligence relationship that has thrived for more than 80 years. Britain has long played a role in countering drug smuggling in the Caribbean, where it has several overseas territories. Last year HMS Trent, a patrol vessel, seized £750m ($980m) of illegal drugs in the region. British

officials have worked closely with Joint Interagency Task Force South, a group that monitors smuggling. They are now plainly worried that America might use British intelligence, such as intercepts that show the location of boats, to commit war crimes. (On November 11th Colombia announced that it, too, would suspend intelligence-sharing with America.)

Intelligence cut-offs have been surprisingly common within the Five Eyes pact (which comprises America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand), says Richard Aldrich, a historian. They have often been instigated by policymakers who want to send a diplomatic message. He points to the example of America punishing Canada for its failure to send ships in the Gulf war in 1991. But they are much rarer within the tight-knit Anglo- American partnership. “I genuinely can’t think of when we stopped sharing with the US,” says a former British intelligence official.

America’s use of torture during its global war on terror caused consternation in Britain, and might have prompted a similar cut-off, but by the time those abuses came to light America had largely stopped torturing people, so British spooks were able to continue co-operation. Not every scrap is always handed over: some intelligence is marked UKEO, or “UK Eyes Only”. The agreement between Britain and America allows for a party to declare that it won’t share on a specific topic, but the expectation is that that would be exceptional. Particularly in signals intelligence (SIGINT), which includes intercepting communications, the presumption is to share.

“There tend to be ways of working these things out without going nuclear,” says the former official. Another person with knowledge of intelligence- sharing recalls a similar episode which was not made public. “We handled it quietly.”

In the Caribbean Britain’s approach—like America’s until recently—has been to interdict and board suspect vessels. In the past Royal Navy sharpshooters have disabled boats. “We never contemplated sinking them,” says another intelligence official previously involved in such efforts. “It would have been flat-out illegal.”

The British intelligence cut-off is likely to be a minor inconvenience to the American killing spree in the Caribbean. Intelligence on smuggling was

“overwhelmingly American”, says the second official, with Britain playing a minor role. But there are worries that Donald Trump, now that the news is out, might respond angrily.

That could hurt British interests, warns a third former British intelligence official with close ties to the American agencies. Mr Trump is acutely sensitive to any suggestion that spy agencies might be obstructing his agenda. He has purged his own services, firing the heads of both the National Security Agency—which is closely intertwined with GCHQ, Britain’s SIGINT agency—and the Defence Intelligence Agency. He has also dismissed officials involved in investigating his ties to Russia in the run-up to the 2016 election.

Britain, says this third official, now faces a real risk of being cut off in retaliation from some American intelligence. That, too, would be a break from the past. In the 1970s Henry Kissinger, as national security adviser, ordered a punitive cut-off of some intelligence, causing satellite images to dry up briefly, but it was resisted by American spies and proved perfunctory. “Despite what anyone says”, adds the official, “we need them far more than they need us.” ■
