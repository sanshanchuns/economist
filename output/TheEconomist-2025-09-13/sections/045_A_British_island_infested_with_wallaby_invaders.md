IF YOU GO looking for wallabies around the Ballaugh Curragh, a mossy wetland on the Isle of Man, you will almost certainly find them. They will cautiously look in your direction, hopping away only if you step on a twig or get too close. A wild population of red-necked wallabies, named after their distinctive patch of rust-coloured fur, has lived on the island since the 1960s, when a few escaped from a wildlife park. Some conservationists feel the time has come to intervene. The marsupials, native to Australia, have adapted well to the Isle of Man’s temperate climate. Drone surveys show around 1,000 feral wallabies living on the island, far more than previous estimates of up to 200. Over time, they

have become part of the island’s identity. A stuffed wallaby is displayed in a glass cabinet at the Manx Museum.

Though cute, the “mob” (as wallabies are collectively known) poses a threat to the Isle of Man’s ecology. “Island ecosystems are always fragile,” says Graham Makepeace-Warne, CEO of the Manx Wildlife Trust, a charity. The wallabies nibble native vegetation, stripping back ferns and wild flowers, and disrupt local wildlife. They also damage fences as they roam, causing livestock to escape.

The wallabies’ welfare is a concern, too. The population, descended from just a few animals, probably suffers from a “genetic bottleneck”, says Arno Wuenschmann, a professor of veterinary pathology at the University of Minnesota and a regular visitor to the Isle of Man. They are vulnerable to health complications from inbreeding. A pilot study conducted by Dr Wuenschmann and the Manx Wildlife Trust suggested that some of the wallabies suffer from visual impairments caused by a parasitic infection. Farmers worry they might pass on diseases to livestock.

Options for managing the mob include a cull, fencing them into specific zones or sterilising them. All are problematic. Culling is controversial.

Fences often don’t work because wallabies are skilled escape artists. And sterilisation requires specialist skills not routinely available on the island.

“I don’t personally think that wallabies have a place on the Isle of Man,” says Laura McCoy, curator of natural history for Manx National Heritage. She believes the island should learn from Australia and New Zealand, which are “very effective” in educating people about ecology and supporting native biota. In New Zealand wallabies are seen as a pest and culls have taken place.

Though the Isle of Man’s mob is almost certainly the biggest in Britain, it is not the only one. Perhaps the best-known was in the Peak District, which survived for decades after escaping from a private zoo during the second world war. Though this colony probably died out around 2008, it lingers in the local imagination: a wallaby sculpture trail opened in the area this summer. Wallabies have been spotted in recent years in Devon, the Chiltern Hills, Cornwall, Nottinghamshire and Inchconnachan, in Scotland.

A warming climate will make Britain a more favourable habitat for wallabies in years to come, believes Anthony Caravaggi, a biologist at the University of South Wales. “The dynamics of nature in the UK are changing rapidly,” he says. “And wallabies are just one part of that.”■
