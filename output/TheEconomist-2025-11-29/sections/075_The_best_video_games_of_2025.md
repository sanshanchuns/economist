“Cabernet”This game, set in eastern Europe in the 19th century, follows Liza, a vampire. Players are forced to make moral choices as they seek victims, befriend them and then drink their blood. “Civilization VII”For over 30 years the “Civilization” games have allowed gamers to explore how societies grow into empires. This title is perhaps the most ambitious to date. Players transition through ancient, medieval and modern times. “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach”This game is set in a world where almost everyone is locked inside, terrified of a hostile world. (Sound familiar?)

Players deliver parcels in this wonderfully strange story full of enigmatic characters and enjoyable quests.

“Donkey Kong Bananza” Nintendo produced this game—in which Donkey Kong smashes stuff in search of rewards—to accompany the launch of its Switch 2 console. It demonstrates the firm’s enduring design sensibilities.

“Ghost of Yotei”A vengeful samurai murders her way through enemy territory. The missions are fun, but it is a pleasure to wander round this splendidly rendered version of 17th-century Japan.

“Hades II”Melinoe enters the underworld to defeat Chronos, the Titan of time. The game’s fights feature cleverly designed versions of Greek mythological figures. Success in battle is hard-won.

“Hollow Knight: Silksong”Developed over the course of almost a decade, “Hollow Knight: Silksong” is extremely difficult. Players have to negotiate a labyrinth while overcoming an impressive array of baddies and obstacles.

“The Roottrees are Dead”A rich family have died in a plane crash. In this detective game, it is your job to find out who will inherit their wealth. As you pore over documents and diaries, you realise the family had plenty to hide.

“Split Fiction”A tech company steals authors’ story ideas and turns them into simulated worlds. When two writers agree to test out “The Machine”, they have to escape prisons of their own imagination. An intelligent multiplayer game.

“Two Point Museum”The previous “Two Point” games offered humorously subtle takes on managing a hospital and a university. Now comes a museum. Decisions must be made on everything from wages to the placement of prized exhibits.■
