Bit by bit, HR is taking over corporate life. The ranks of human-resources professionals across the rich world are swelling. Their roles are expanding. And some are still insisting that you complete your unconscious-bias training. In 2024 American businesses employed 1.3m HR professionals, up by 64% in ten years, compared with 14% growth for overall employment (see chart 1). The trend is also evident in Australia, Britain and Germany. HR has moved up the office pecking order, too. A study by Nick Bloom and Mert Akan of Stanford University shows that the pay of chief human-resources officers (CHROs) has grown relative to that of other senior executives. In 1992 their total compensation (including bonuses and stock options) was

40% of the average director’s salary (excluding chief executives). By 2022 that figure had risen to 70%. More CHROs have also been moving into the corner office. Mary Barra, the boss of General Motors, previously held the carmaker’s top HR job. Firms such as Dunkin’ Brands, a doughnut specialist, have also given the top job to HR gurus.

Various forces are behind HR’s rise. One is the growing value of top talent. In an annual global survey by Manpower Group, a recruiter, 74% of firms said this year that they were experiencing a shortage of skilled labour, up from 38% a decade ago. Ageing populations and technologies such as artificial intelligence, which require new skills, are among the causes.

A string of disruptions to work has also elevated HR. It has been a “non-stop game day”, says Emilie Petrone of Korn Ferry, an HR consultancy. The
#MeToo movement shone a spotlight on office harassment. The covid-19
pandemic meant HR staff had to manage a shift to remote working while monitoring employees’ wellbeing. Work-from-home policies and return-to- office mandates followed. Then came the rise of diversity, equity and inclusivity (DEI) initiatives. For a profession that is “prone to scramble around for fashions and fads”, as one HR director puts it, DEI brought plenty to deal with, from micro-aggressions to non-gendered toilets.

Other factors have also contributed to HR’s rise. State governments in America are enacting more rules on matters such as sick leave and minimum wages, increasing the compliance burden for companies. Employees seem better informed about their rights as well—and happier to complain. In American workplaces the average number of allegations of discrimination or harassment jumped from 6 per 1,000 employees in 2021 to 15 last year, according to a survey by HR Acuity, a software provider.

Yet there are signs that the HR boom could soon turn to bust. America’s labour market has been characterised by low hiring and low firing for much of the past year, meaning less work for HR. Now lay-offs have jumped. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, the number of lay-offs announced reached more than 153,000 in October, the highest since the pandemic. While that may give HR teams plenty of paperwork to do, some are finding themselves part of the cull. Amazon, an e-commerce giant, is said to have included many HR roles in the 14,000 jobs it cut last month. Meanwhile, at least in America, enthusiasm for DEI has faded amid complaints of “wokeness”.

AI may make matters worse. For now, HR teams are busy retraining staff and hiring AI whizzes. Moderna, a drugmaker, has even merged its IT and HR functions, under the leadership of the former CHRO.

In the long run, however, many HR tasks may be farmed out to AI. Companies already use the technology to scan through piles of CVs and create chatbots that can answer employees’ questions. In a survey published this month, McKinsey, another consultancy, asked companies around the world how headcount had changed across various business functions over the past year as a result of AI. Fully 22% of respondents said that it had led to a decrease in the number of HR workers, more than for any other function, with only 5% saying it had led to an increase (see chart 2). For the people people, the rise of the machines looks like bad news. ■
