It was not the verdict artists hoped for. On November 4th the High Court ruled that Stability ai, a technology company, was not liable for copyright infringement despite training its image generator with content from Getty Images, a media firm. The case was an early British attempt to answer questions about whether ai firms should be allowed to train their systems using copyrighted materials generated by people. Getty lost not because evidence was lacking but because legislation is outdated. Britain’s copyright laws were written before the notion of robots trained on human art was conceivable. In her ruling, Judge Joanna Smith described her findings as “historic and extremely limited in scope”, judicial

shorthand for saying she had little choice. The decision leaves both the tech industry and the creative sector eager for clearer rules.

The government is keen to encourage ai firms to invest in Britain. But the country has high commercial electricity prices—a big disincentive for an energy-hungry industry. And the ruling highlights another drawback. Firms will be reluctant to invest without guarantees that they will not face lawsuits for training their models on material that is copyrighted in Britain.

In December 2024 ministers launched a consultation on ai and copyright, aiming to establish a framework that “rewards human creativity, incentivises innovation and provides legal certainty”. That is easier said than done. Britain enjoys a global reputation for its creative sector. Artists such as J.K. Rowling and Ed Sheeran boost the economy and, in a hard-to-measure way, national pride. The prospect of ai ingesting their work is controversial.

In 2021 a consultation on ai and intellectual property received fewer than 100 responses. The current one got over 11,500. Hundreds of writers, musicians and artists signed an open letter accusing Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, of “giving away” their work. One proposal in the government’s consultation is to let tech firms train models on copyrighted works unless the rights holder opts out, as is the case in the eu. Many artists see the opt-out exception as burdensome.

Hopes are now pinned on the outcome of the government consultation. “The government needs to decide which way to jump. Will it change the law to favour the content creators, or ai?” says Arty Rajendra, head of ip disputes at Osborne Clarke, a law firm. The longer policymakers dither, the greater the danger that technology firms will settle on countries like America and Japan, where the rules suit them better. ■
