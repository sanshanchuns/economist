“FACT” proclaims the opening page. “All artwork, artefacts, symbols and documents in this novel are real.” It goes on: “All experiments” are “true to life”. Finally, it adds: “All organisations in this novel exist.” For the reader this list is at once intellectually exciting—for who is not partial to a real- world thriller with added artworks—and grammatically a little troubling. Because surely that is not one, singular “FACT” but three “FACTS”? As a piece of preamble it is great. As a piece of English writing, it feels a little off. But that is hardly important, because this book, “The Secret of Secrets”, is by Dan Brown. For the past 20-odd years he has specialised in novels that

offer facts which are just about right and prose which is just a bit wrong. He has done splendidly well out of that formula. His books, including titles such as “The Da Vinci Code”, “Angels and Demons” and “Inferno”, have sold over 250m copies, been made into films and translated into 56 languages. A recent YouGov poll of the most famous fiction books put “The Da Vinci Code” at 12, far above Charlotte Brontë’s “Jane Eyre” (73rd) and George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” (81st). Mr Brown matters.

He matters despite his use of phrases such as, “His eyes went white, like a shark about to attack.” Over the years critics have delighted in pointing out such literary flaws. There have been parodies (“Renowned author Dan Brown woke up in his luxurious four-poster bed in his expensive $10m house…”), hatchet jobs (“Bilge” sniffed one) and even a “Dan Brown Sequel Generator” (“Plug in a city and a sect, and our computer will do the rest”).

Though many laugh at Mr Brown, lots of readers take his books very seriously indeed. The novels may contain all those FACTS, but they also interweave them with a lot of total bunkum. His books both use conspiracy theories—about the Illuminati, or the Freemasons, or whether Jesus married, or albino monks—and spawn them. Google the words “was Mary…” and the search engine volunteers “…Magdalene married to Jesus?” You less read Mr Brown than triangulate him—book in one hand, phone in the other—to verify each fact.

The latest book does not disappoint on that score. As it opens, Robert Langdon, the “world-renowned scholar of religious symbology” (FACT: don’t even bother Googling that one) is in Prague with his new love, the “internationally acclaimed noetic scientist” (FACT: a real job that simply sounds fake) where they bump into a neuroscientist (FACT: no one in Dan Brown’s books ever seems to work as an accountant) and head out to drink cocktails, argue about the problem of consciousness and use words like “metaphysical”.

And, at first, everything seems peachy. Langdon has a nice time staying in the swanky Four Seasons hotel; his lover has a nice time giving the sort of lectures that receive standing ovations; everyone thinks helpful expository thoughts, rendered in italics. “I’m alone on Charles Bridge,” thinks Langdon

when he is alone on Charles Bridge. “I am a neuroscientist,” thinks the neuroscientist. “I am a healthy 49-year-old woman,” thinks a healthy 49- year-old woman. “I may have made a mistake forking out $38 for this book,” thinks the reader who has just forked out $38 for this book.

But then the action gets going. By page 34, world-renowned symbologist Langdon has lost his lover, gained a mortal enemy and jumped, fully clothed, into the Vltava river. Soon the pages are awash with yet more police, kidnappings, passwords, puzzles, ancient whatsits, cryptic this-es, Christian thats, a Golem (don’t ask) and an awful lot of increasingly baffling initials—CIA, ESP, SUV, ÚZSI, WTF?

At the heart of this book—as with all of Mr Brown’s books—is an idea. “The Da Vinci Code” was based on the idea that evidence of Jesus’s “marriage” can be seen in Leonardo da Vinci’s painting “The Last Supper”. “Inferno” seemed based on the idea that novels about arty Italian stuff sell well. This one is based on the idea that the world is about to experience a sea change in its understanding of the nature of consciousness. That might sound like a lot to crowbar into a lighthearted thriller, but not for Mr Brown, who simply has a character say: “We are about to experience a sea change in our understanding of…the nature of consciousness.”

The precise change mooted is the idea that the human mind does not merely observe reality: it in some way creates it. If that sounds odd, this book argues it is not as alien or new as it might sound. A similar idea underlies many spiritual and inspirational teachings. Langdon helpfully lists some: “Buddha: With our thoughts, we create the world.” And “Jesus: Whatever you ask for in prayer, it will be yours.” And, he adds: “Business guru Robin Sharma…: Everything is created twice; first in the mind, and then in reality.” (FACT: that last one might have been a bit of an error of tone.)

Anyway, whatever, who cares, as the reader is soon off again, racing through Prague, past the possible evidence of villainy and the clear evidence of an awful lot of diligent research. Readers dash up the Petřín Tower (pausing from life-or-death pursuit merely to note that it was built “in 1891” with “an open-lattice construction of riveted steel beams and supports”), past Prague’s Astronomical Tower (whose “172-step ascent” rewards visitors with “stunning vistas as well as an absorbing exhibit of 18th-century astronomical

instruments”) and along so many accurately transcribed foreign names— Křižovnická Street, Tržiště Street—that this feels less like an action thriller than an A-Z in pacey prose. Mr Brown may have a problem with critics. Diacritics he has completely nailěd.

Critics will lay into this book. But it romps along and, in truth, its exposition is part of its appeal. Mr Brown takes things people want to understand but don’t—Italian art, Christian history, stuff in Latin—and explains them in a way that they can. For all the nonsense, there is an appealing autodidactic earnestness to his books and their less-than-riveting asides about rivets. It is hard to remember now, but reviews of “The Da Vinci Code” were glowing —an “exhilaratingly brainy thriller”, gushed the New York Times. Those days are gone; the world feels less naive. But in this darker new world it is somehow comforting to settle down with the lumbering, world-renowned Robert Langdon, who, after all, is world-renowned for a reason. ■
