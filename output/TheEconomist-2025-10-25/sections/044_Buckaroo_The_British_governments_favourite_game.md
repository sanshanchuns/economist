“Buckaroo!”, the children’s game where players stack cowboy gear onto a mule until it bucks, turns 55 this year. Although aimed at four-year-olds, it is surprisingly popular among British ministers, who see it as a policy guide rather than a pastime. Once politicians find a certain sector to act as a beast of burden—whether housing, energy or pharma—they load it with as much as they can. It works for a while. But eventually the pieces end up scattered. The game has been played for years in the housing sector. Due to the peculiarities of Britain’s rules on building, developers have found themselves responsible for everything from spending 1% of their building costs on public art to providing councils with social housing, points out Paul

Smith, a planning expert. These obligations, when coupled with higher interest rates, have made it remarkably unprofitable to build in parts of the country, and particularly in London. In the first half of this year construction was started on 2,158 homes in London. It is well short of the 88,000 the capital is expected to build each year. A supply dip has become a drought. The mule can bear no more.

Sometimes the mule asks not to play. Energy companies have been laden with green levies, tariffs and obligations, which now account for about a fifth of annual bills for the typical household. The costs of decarbonising Britain must be borne somewhere. But where? This question was put to energy executives at a recent select committee, which wanted to hear straight from the mule’s mouth. Chris O’Shea, the well-remunerated chief executive of Centrica, an energy company, said: “They should be on general taxation because that is more progressive.” Bill Esterson, an mp from Labour, Britain’s biggest progressive party, replied: “That’s not gonna happen.” And so the meeting started umming and ahhing over whether to add a shovel or a canteen to the horse.

Being kicked by a mule hurts. Britain’s government has a testy relationship with pharmaceutical companies over the state’s stinginess when it comes to paying for drugs. When a “voluntary” rebate—which in effect caps how much the National Health Service will pay each year for drugs—hit 23% this year, the industry whinnied. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, refused to budge. Shortly after Mr Streeting’s defiance, high-profile pharma investments in Britain started being cancelled, in the same way Russian dissidents started falling out of windows after the country’s invasion of Ukraine. The industry bucked, Mr Streeting received a plastic hoof to the head and a retreat is now likely.

Sometimes the mule has yet to buck. Visa fees have become a money- spinner. It can cost almost £6,000 ($8,020) up front to bring in a scientist, according to the Royal Society, a scientific academy. Other visas cost as much as £12,500. Such fees have jumped by 79% in real terms since 2019 and now bring in nearly £3bn a year (0.1% of gdp). But a policy aimed at raising a little cash may start to deter people the country wants. Immigration is already falling sharply. Soon enough the question will shift from “Where

did everybody come from?” to “Where did everybody go?” and “Why is that plastic cowboy hat flying through the air?”

Part of the problem is “everythingism”. This is the government’s tendency to make every decision a “means for promoting every national objective, all at the same time”, according to Re:State, a think-tank. The result is often sweeping obligations balanced haphazardly on projects. A recent government tender for designing small modular nuclear reactors (smrs) demanded that half of employees working on the project should be women, according to Britain Remade, another think-tank. Building smrs is already tricky and expensive. Why make it harder? Buckaroo policy combines the left’s love for fussy obligations with the right’s blind faith in the market to fix endemic social problems.

Business is treated as a beast able to carry whatever government heaps on its back. It has been able to bear heavy loads, such as leaving the eu or an ever- increasing minimum wage, with little complaint. Smaller inconveniences have been hitherto largely ignored. After all, global companies do not pay much attention to whatever “social-value” scheme a junior minister has cooked up in, say, their eighth-biggest market. Since business did not bridle, government piled on more. When judged on the past decade, Britain’s corporate lobbyists have a good claim to be the least effective in the rich world. It has, however, reached a point where existing burdens mean a light addition can trigger a wild kick from even the most pliant beast.

British business is seen as a dependable workhorse. Voters, however, are treated as skittish foals that will rear up at the slightest burden, even by a Labour government. For all the whining about Britain enduring the highest tax burden in the post-war era, income taxes on median earners are the lowest they have been in half a century. The basic rate of income tax has not increased since 1975. Labour has pledged not to break that trend. It is a fight that successive governments have been unwilling to have.

And so inside the Treasury a particularly consequential game of “Buckaroo!” is afoot ahead of the budget on November 26th. Officials, advisers and ministers are working out how to fill a funding gap of nearly £30bn, gingerly placing a plastic rope on a red saddle. Maybe partners at law firms and accounting firms should pay more. Perhaps a mansion tax is the

best way of keeping Labour’s promise on tax (which it arguably broke at the last budget when it increased taxes on, naturally, employers). “Buckaroo!” is, however, a silly game. Bold, broad taxes are best, rather than placing yet more narrow ones on already strained sectors. When it comes to “Buckaroo!”, the way to avoid defeat is not to play. ■
