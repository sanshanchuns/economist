When sir keir starmer announced on September 26th that Britain would introduce a national digital-identity system, he might have expected a lukewarm, even an enthusiastic response. Think-tanks had written reports arguing that Britons were strongly in favour of the idea. And the prime minister invoked the great anxiety of the day. A digital-identity system would prevent illegal working and thereby reduce Britain’s appeal to illicit migrants, he said. Nice try. A few hours after Sir Keir’s announcement, YouGov released an opinion poll showing that a slight majority were opposed. The Daily Mail, a popular newspaper, described the policy as East German. A petition to

Parliament entitled “Do not introduce digital id cards” quickly amassed 2.7m signatures. Michelle O’Neill, the first minister of Northern Ireland, called the scheme “ludicrous” and “ill-thought-out”.

Sir Keir has wandered blithely into a treacherous policy area. Many British governments have wanted to introduce a single, universal way of proving identity. They succeeded twice, during the first and second world wars, but the measures did not endure. This is a shame. Britain sorely needs a secure digital-id system, and needs to decide what kind it wants.

The country seems ever more like an outlier. Most European countries issue identity cards. These are linked to digital-id systems that enable residents to do many things securely, including ordering medical prescriptions, enrolling children in school and signing digital documents. Even the privacy-obsessed Swiss narrowly voted for a digital id on September 28th.

“We have to prove who we are all the time,” says Alexander Iosad of the Tony Blair Institute, a pro-id think-tank. But Britons are asked to prove their identities in ways that are both insecure and burdensome. New employees are often asked for passports; people buying booze show driving licences; weightier events such as marriage can require birth certificates.

Sometimes this is mere identity theatre. A government survey of employers in September 2024 showed that 62% think a British driving licence can be used to prove that a person is allowed to work (it cannot). At other times Britain’s sloppy approach to identity weakens people’s defences against the state. The Windrush scandal of 2018 involved officials persecuting long- settled migrants who had the right to live in Britain but could not prove it.

The government says that by the summer of 2029 everyone must use digital id to prove they are allowed to work. It also says that the police will not demand to see digital ids. It has said nothing about what kind of identity system the country should build. Britain has many options, but one big question: how much should the state try to do by itself?

The government has already created applications that look like components of a European-style digital-id system. There is an nhs app and a “government gateway” for tax returns. Many migrants have e-visas. A

system called One Login enables people to do lots of things, from cancelling a stolen passport to getting a permit to dredge for scallops in Wales. Digital driving licences are on their way.

Next to those government initiatives sit many digital-verification-services firms. Some Britons became aware of them over the summer. Thanks to the Online Safety Act, websites containing pornography and other things that children are not supposed to see began asking users to take selfies or supply their credit-card numbers. The asking and the age-checking was often done by verification firms. The government has encouraged the growth of this industry. It will soon allow people to use private verification services to prove they are old enough to buy alcohol, for example.

“The government has got to be careful,” argues Robin Tombs of Yoti, a firm involved in many aspects of identity verification. It could try to dominate the field, by insisting that people use government identity systems for almost all digital interactions. That would have the advantage of consistency but the disadvantage of suppressing competition and innovation.

The state can mess up, as immigrants know. Those with e-visas must prove their right to work and rent property by using government websites to generate codes, which employers and landlords check online. Andreea Dumitrache of the3million, a group that represents eu migrants, says things go wrong at every stage of the process. Her group has argued that migrants should be issued with id cards as a backup. “Our community is used to having ids,” she points out.

Minimising the role of the state might help with another problem. Ms O’Neill’s objection to a British digital-id scheme is partly constitutional. The Good Friday Agreement enables people in Northern Ireland to maintain an Irish identity if they wish. The more an id system resembles a British government identity system, the greater the chance that she, and many people in Northern Ireland, refuse to have anything to do with it.■
