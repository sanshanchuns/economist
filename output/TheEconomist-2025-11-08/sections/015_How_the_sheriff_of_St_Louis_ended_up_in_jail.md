AS ACCUSATIONS go, one levelled at the sheriff of St Louis, the second- largest city in Missouri, in a lawsuit to remove him from office, was outlandish. In late June Andrew Bailey, then the attorney-general of the state, accused Alfred Montgomery of hiring his half-brother as a deputy. This, Mr Bailey alleged, constituted “an outright violation of the Missouri Constitution’s ban on nepotism”. Yet the deputy, Malik Taylor, was not his sibling. He was just a man Mr Montgomery, who is black, referred to as “brother” frequently. In August that charge was dropped. Nonetheless Mr Montgomery is in jail, accused of more crimes by federal prosecutors, these based on somewhat more credible evidence (he denies the charges). The first indictment relates to an incident in which he handcuffed

the acting head of the city jail. He was jailed after a second indictment, accusing him of using a secret burner phone to threaten a witness in the first case. The saga is, to St Louis’s Democratic leaders, a deep source of embarrassment. Yet it is also, in a way, evidence of why American cities are so difficult to run, and why that is so hard to change, especially in Republican-led states.

The unasked question around the whole incident is why does St Louis even have an elected sheriff? Few cities in America have one of their own, and in St Louis the job is unusually limited in scope—the sheriff moves prisoners around, but he does not run the jail or do any real policing. What he can do is mess things up. Mr Montgomery’s first action was to fire his predecessor’s underlings, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on severance payments. Then he splashed money around on gold-plated badges, surveillance robots and golf carts to transport equipment between buildings. Within a few months the department was facing a serious budget crisis.

To Republicans, who control the state government, it is all just more evidence that the city cannot run itself. Until recently St Louis had the highest murder rate of any in America. According to state tests just 15% of pupils in the city’s school district are proficient in maths, and barely a fifth in English. Earlier this year Mike Kehoe, the Republican governor, signed a law taking over the police department from the city and handing it to an appointed board—not for the first time. The education system could well be next.

Yet according to Vincent Schoemehl, a former mayor, the problem is not exactly who is in charge. Rather it is that power is too diffuse to get anything done. St Louis has nine city-wide elected positions. New York City has just three. Residents also vote for aldermen, and the schools are run by an elected board of seven members.

Some of this dysfunction dates back to the civil war, when the city backed the union and the state governor the confederacy. In 1876 the city divorced itself from the neighbouring St Louis county. But white flight and suburbanisation has accentuated the problem—the city has lost two thirds of its population since the 1950s, mostly to the county. With local media now

much diminished, factional politics tends to determine who wins elections. Turnout in the last mayoral election, in April, reached just 26%.

Merging local government agencies could both save money and improve accountability. Nowadays the county is a mess too, for similar reasons. It has 88 different municipalities and 23 school districts. The county’s population is also now shrinking too. But, jokes Mr Schoemel, why would Republicans bother? It is easier to blame Democrats than to do anything to help the city fix its own problems. “It’s like free entertainment,” he says. ■
