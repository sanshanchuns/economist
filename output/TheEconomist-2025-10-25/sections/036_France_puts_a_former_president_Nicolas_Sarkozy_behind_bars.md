Apart from the wartime collaborationist leader, Marshal Pétain, the last French head of state to be sent to prison after leaving office was Louis XVI in 1792. On October 21st, for the first time in modern France, a former president—Nicolas Sarkozy—was put behind bars. Driven from his home and escorted by police outriders, Mr Sarkozy is now in jail at the Prison de la Santé, in southern Paris. A judge on September 25th found Mr Sarkozy guilty of “criminal conspiracy” in a trial over the illicit financing of his 2007 presidential campaign by Muammar Qaddafi, the former Libyan dictator. The former president, said the judge, had “allowed his close aides” to solicit funds,

although she could not “establish proof” that money was ultimately used to finance the campaign. Mr Sarkozy was acquitted of three other, more serious, charges, including corruption and embezzlement. The judge sentenced him to five years in prison with immediate effect, meaning that he is now serving time even while he appeals.

Mr Sarkozy has repeatedly said that he is innocent. “I am not afraid of prison,” the 70-year-old told a French newspaper before his incarceration; “I will hold my head high, including in front of the gates.” For his safety, Mr Sarkozy is being held in a solitary unit, in a cell about ten square metres in size. Mr Sarkozy’s lawyers immediately lodged a request with the appeals court for conditional release.

The fact that a former president, in office from 2007 to 2012, is serving time, let alone while on appeal, has shaken France—and divided it. The left broadly applauded the ruling, judging that he has been treated like any other citizen. Many of Mr Sarkozy’s political friends on the right, by contrast, think that the judges are politically motivated and have long been out to get him. President Emmanuel Macron, who has urged people to respect judicial independence, suggested this week that a political debate about the immediate application of sentences before an appeal has been heard would be “legitimate”.

It is quite a turnaround from the days when French politicians were seen as the beneficiaries of a culture of impunity. Criminal cases against politicians often failed to reach court, or were dropped because of the statute-of- limitations rule. Jacques Chirac became the first former president in modern times to be tried in court, in a case over “fake jobs” at the Paris town hall during his stint as mayor. In 2011 he was found guilty and given a suspended sentence. Since then a steady procession of politicians has filed in and out of the courtroom. Mr Sarkozy himself has this year worn an electronic tag after a conviction for corruption and influence-peddling in a separate case. A handful of politicians have also served time behind bars.

By the standards of other Western democracies, Mr Sarkozy’s incarceration stands out for the severity of the ruling in his case. But it also fits a pattern under which politicians in France are increasingly being held to account by

the judiciary. The country, it seems, no longer tolerates the practices to which it once turned a blind eye. ■
