BRITISH POLICE believe their seizure of 61,000 bitcoin from a Chinese citizen is the largest of cryptocurrency anywhere. At current prices, the stash is worth more than $7bn. On September 29th the 47-year-old woman, Qian Zhimin, pleaded guilty in a court in London to possessing “criminal property”. China’s state media have called her the ringleader of a massive pyramid scheme that was busted in 2017. She will be sentenced in November. By the time Chinese police dismantled Ms Qian’s operation, nearly 130,000 people, many of them elderly, had put money into it, hoping for promised returns of between 100% and 300%. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn

yuan ($5.6bn)—an average of 310,000 yuan per person. The scheme was run by Ms Qian’s company, Tianjin Blue Sky Grid Electronic Technology, which claimed to be involved in everything from bitcoin mining to the sale of air purifiers. In fact the firm’s funds mainly came from depositors who, in typical Ponzi fashion, were offered rewards to recruit others, thereby ensuring the scheme’s survival.

Scams roil China. On September 29th 11 people were sentenced to death for their involvement in a crime syndicate in Myanmar accused of running phone scams and illegal online-gambling platforms in China that made more than $1.4bn. In June an online investment company called Xinkangjia suddenly closed, leaving its 2m investors with nothing. It, too, had offered implausibly high returns. Police are looking into what happened to the 13bn yuan put into the scheme.

According to Chinese media, Ms Qian used 1.1bn yuan—just a small share of the money she took from investors—to buy her bitcoin. Fake documents allowed her to flee to Britain, where she and two accomplices were eventually arrested after attempted use of the bitcoin to buy lavish property triggered investigations. This involved “unprecedented co-operation” with police in China, London’s police said.

The case has drawn much attention in China. On social media, many note the apparent ease with which Ms Qian was able to use bitcoin to get vast sums out of China despite the government’s tight controls on moving money abroad: the usual limit is $50,000 per year. They have also noted the irony of the outcome. Bitcoin has risen so much in value that what she bought is now worth about $1bn more than the total sum investors put into her firm.■
