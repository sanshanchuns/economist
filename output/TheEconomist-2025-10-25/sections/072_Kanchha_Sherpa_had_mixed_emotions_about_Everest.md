When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the top of Everest on May 29th 1953, Kanchha Sherpa, then 19, was at the camp below. Two other Sherpas were with him, picked like him because they could manage, without supplementary oxygen, to climb to 27,000 feet. And not just climb, in a freezing wind that seeped into their bones and ex-army boots that hurt their feet. They also had to carry on their backs sleeping bags, ropes, spare oxygen cylinders and all the other gear the mountaineers needed for their last lap. At the South Summit they put up the tent in which Hillary and Tenzing stayed overnight; and it was not until the two men came down to them, jubilant, that they heard the news. After that moment of pure joy,

hugging and a bit of dancing, they got the stuff together to carry it to base camp again.

His primary duty all through the expedition, once the ascent was too steep for yaks, was to carry the kerosene and the stoves. It was on these that the mountaineers cooked their strange Western food, all in cans. He had tried it, and the powdered orangeade was all he could take. Sherpas and porters like him just ate their usual tsampa, barley porridge, hot or cold and mixed with melted snow. That was as good as oxygen to him.

Besides porterage, he had had to help with scores of other Sherpas to build six camps and lay a path up the mountain. At one point, Khumba Icefall, recent snowfall had opened up a huge crevasse that blocked their way. Without ladders to scale almost 3,000 feet they could not go on, so ten of them hiked back to his home village, Namche Bazaar, and cut down ten tall trees to make a bridge. Each Sherpa then carried a tree to the icefall. The advantage of living in that part of Nepal, the gateway to Everest, was that it had plenty of trees. His grandfather, who had helped to found the settlement, had also survived by raiding the forest, in his case for tubers and nettles.

That said, however, Namche was not an easy place to live. There was little to do but grow potatoes, which were traded for almost everything else: salt, sugar, even the corn and millet Kanchha’s family grew on their smallholding. His job from boyhood (having never gone to school) was to trade whatever the family had, walking for days through the vast mountains to India or Tibet. His first trip was to take 30 kilos of Nepalese paper to Tibet to make prayer-wheels. Later, with his keen teenage eye for opportunities, he sold surplus Himalayan sheepdogs, strays rounded up in the village, to eager buyers in India for eight rupees each. The mountains were his marketplace.

Yet he was still not prospering as he wanted to. Men in other villages had better clothes and more money. Fairly soon he realised that their secret lay in Darjeeling, where they found jobs guiding climbers. His father, himself a mountaineer, knew Tenzing, so Kanchha set off for Darjeeling (a walk of five days) to see him; and Tenzing hired him as a porter for the Hillary expedition. The job was for 90 days at eight rupees a day, enormous money. He was also given crampons, up-to-date climbing gear and extra-thick

clothes, all of which he sold later to feed his six children. It was therefore not surprising that, for two decades more, he worked as a high-altitude helper for mountaineers while his whole village grew rich round him.

Yet there was another side to all this that troubled him. As a child he was taught that Everest was the holiest of mountains: Chomolungma, Mother Goddess of the World. He never saw her close, but heard the tales from older folk. In those days no villager would dream of setting foot there. When he first did, on the expedition, he was careful to say his Buddhist puja, his commitment to the right path, and to climb with respect. As he gained height he increasingly marvelled at the pristine beauty of the mountain and the number of glaciers he could see. But when Chomolungma was “conquered”, that path he had laid soon drew dozens, then hundreds of people towards the peak. They left behind tents, mattresses, food wrappings, cigarette butts and their own filth, dirtying the goddess. This was terrible.

The mountains were also changing. Around Base Camp there was once lush grass, with yaks grazing. Gradually, it became packed earth and rocks. Peaks once white with snow turned black; glaciers melted almost before his eyes. He did not think this was global warming, though he had heard about that. The reason was simpler, that the goddess and the gods had been stepped on; and they were angry.

His answer was to have just one climbing season a year. But he could not pretend he was sorry that visitors had flooded into Namche. Without them, what would people do? It would be back to sitting around and living off potatoes; back to being poor, or trading illegally. For a while he sold Swiss watches, bought for 300 rupees in Kolkata, for 3,000 rupees to Chinese soldiers stationed in Tibet. Those handy profits landed him in jail.

Eventually he ran a hotel in Namche, Nirvana Lodge, where the specialities were Sherpa vegetable stew and a chance for visitors to talk to him, while his wife served milky sweet tea. (The trekkers had taught him to drink alcohol, but he had stopped that.) His children were not mountaineers; two sons ran hotels, on his firm advice. Yet when visitors called to hear his memories, as many did, he would quietly keep fingering his prayer-beads. When he took his morning walk, as a very old man, through streets full of cafés and climbing-gear emporiums, he slowly spun his prayer-wheel.

Several times a day he went to the four local monasteries to pray that climbers and trekkers would be kept safe from avalanches.

He never reached the summit of Everest himself. His best climb still fell 327 feet short. Seven times he asked for a government permit to go higher, but was turned down. Perhaps, after all, it was better he had not committed that ultimate trespass. ■
