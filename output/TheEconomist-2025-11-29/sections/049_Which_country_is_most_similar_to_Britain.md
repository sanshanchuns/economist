Soon after becoming home secretary in September, Shabana Mahmood sent her senior officials to Denmark to learn about its tough asylum system. Of course she did. British politicians and civil servants treat Denmark as magpies are said to treat trinkets. In the past they have raided it for shiny policies on drugs and cycling. In October a delegation arrived to learn about the country’s green-energy accomplishments. One hopes the British state gets a discount on Copenhagen’s hotels.

But what if Denmark is not all that similar to Britain? Indeed, what if British policymakers often study and try to emulate countries that are profoundly different from their home? Dissimilar places can learn from each other in theory, but it is likely to be difficult—like a corner shop trying to copy a multinational, or a tennis player copying a swimmer. A more obvious approach is to study countries with which Britain has much in common.

To work out which countries those might be, The Economist has ranked members of the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries, according to their closeness to Britain on ten chosen indicators. Some of the measures are obvious, like population size, gdp per person and the state of democracy. Others, such as alcohol consumption, the importance of religion and the share of births outside marriage, plumb social and cultural differences (see chart). We add each country’s ranks to work out which is most similar.

Britain turns out to be unlike Denmark on our measures. It is no more similar to Sweden, another Scandinavian country frequently visited by British policy magpies. Both are smaller, richer, happier, more highly taxed and less religious than the United Kingdom. Nor is Britain much like America, a country so fascinating to mps that they scrutinise even minor elections and parrot terms like “step up to the plate”, a baseball reference.

Canada is more like Britain, which helps explain the transatlantic career of Mark Carney, now the country’s prime minister. France is almost identical to Britain in its population and its gdp per person, although its tax burden is higher. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands differ from Britain only a little more than those two. But the country that is most similar to Britain according to our measures is a surprising one: Spain.

Britons spent large parts of the past five centuries alternately warring with and ignoring Spain. They frequently insulted its inhabitants. In the early modern period the Spanish were held to be zealous and cruel. Henry Swinburne, an 18th-century travel writer, called its soldiers “dirty melancholy dwarfs”. Spanish food puzzled or revolted the British for years. George Orwell, who fought in the Spanish civil war, wrote that chorizo sausage tasted of soap and gave him the runs.

Yet Mark Lawrence, whose book “Anglo-Hispania Beyond the Black Legend” catalogues many other misconceptions, points to big similarities. Britain and

Spain both built huge American empires, oppressing the indigenous populations in God’s name, then lost them. Both countries are composite monarchies, which brought together kingdoms with distinct cultures and legal systems. Both contain potent separatist movements today.

Spanish observers have sometimes worried that their country is peripheral to Europe, echoing the remark attributed to the author Alexandre Dumas that Africa begins at the Pyrenees. Britons have sometimes agreed with them. The poet W. H. Auden described Spain as “soldered so crudely to inventive Europe”. But it has become less peripheral, while Britain has become more so since voting to leave the eu in 2016. And British tourists adore Spain. Last year they visited it twice as much as the next-most-popular country, France.

People who have worked in both countries describe a more relaxed attitude to life and a greater fondness for long lunches in Spain. Overall, though, differences are small. Nacho Casajús, a dual citizen who works for the pipeline firm Exolum, thinks that the countries’ inhabitants are similarly self- deprecating. “We always believe that something is wrong, and we learn to live with it,” he says.

As monoglots, Britons study America and Scandinavia partly because their inhabitants speak English. “You copy the lessons you can understand,” says Chris Dottie of Hays, a recruiter, who moved from Britain to Spain. To the extent that they learn foreign languages, though, the British are looking south. Three decades ago German was three times as popular as Spanish as a gcse subject, and French was nine times as popular. Spanish is now more studied than either.

If Britons were to look at Spain, they would see a rapidly growing economy with a relaxed attitude to immigration—in both respects a sharp contrast to their own land. Time to dust off the phrase book and purchase a ticket, chaps.■
