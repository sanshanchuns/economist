Insurgents WHO want to smash the system often end up running it. For Europe’s hard right that outcome is already a glimmer on the horizon. They are ahead in the polls, or thereabouts, in Britain, France and Germany. In Italy they are in power; in the Netherlands they briefly led a coalition; and in Poland in June their presidential candidate saw off the nominee from the centre. By 2027 the hard right could be in office in economies worth getting on for half of European GDP. That would be a grave blow to European prosperity. The direct threat is the hard right’s use of power. They sneer at technocratic management, vow to protect voters from competition and creative destruction and instead offer a seductive combination of handouts and tax cuts. Outright electoral success

would mean more economic stagnation or even rolling bond-market blow- ups. The indirect threat is that in some places mainstream parties are already cowering before the populist uprising, ducking difficult reforms and aping policies from the extremes—a style of government that risks hastening the very hard-right victory they are seeking to avoid.

Europe’s economy has hardly been well run in recent years. Annual GDP is rising at just 1%. Britain’s 30-year-gilt yield reached 5.7% on September 2nd, its highest in over a quarter of a century. After François Bayrou, France’s prime minister, announced a confidence vote in his government, to be held on September 8th, the country’s 30-year-bond yield reached 4.46%, its highest since 2008. Germany, once the continent’s economic motor, has barely grown since 2019.

You might think that such a dismal record only bolsters the case from the hard right that Europe needs a new approach. It does, but not the change they propose. In fact, Europe can ill-afford a period of even worse economic management.

It is worth pinning down where the dangers lie. As we report, hard-right parties have tended to moderate as they have moved closer to power. Proposals to ditch the euro or leave the European Union are now mostly symbolic (though Alternative for Germany still flirts with Dexit). Recognising how Europe is ageing, they now argue for guest-worker schemes to supply new labour, rather than shutting borders altogether. Above all, they want to avoid the sort of economic disruption that scares voters.

However, this resistance to change makes them growth-smotherers. In Italy Giorgia Meloni has been relatively moderate—including towards Europe. But she has avoided growth-boosting reforms that would upset her voters. In AmericaMAGA has a pro-tech, deregulatory wing that competes for the president’s attention against the nostalgia of many Trump supporters. In Europe, by contrast, populism is all about preserving an imaginary past. Hard-right success would lock in Europe’s least productive features: transfers to favoured groups, protectionism and hostility to competition.

An even greater problem is the hard right’s fiscal profligacy. Populist parties almost all advocate a mixture of tax cuts combined with generosity for pensioners and parents of young children—in order to boost the native birth rate. They claim that they will balance the books with huge savings from cutting spending on immigrants, scroungers, public-sector waste and Brussels. Reform UK promises giveaways worth around £200bn ($266bn), or 5% of British GDP, according to our calculations, funded by an incredible £100bn-worth of savings, including an unspecified 5% cut across the whole of government. The party reckons it can find £42bn by cutting immigration and £10bn from better managing public-sector pensions.

Bond markets will surely puncture such illusions. Indeed, the combination of low growth and budgetary ill-discipline leads inexorably towards fiscal crisis. In the best case, this would enforce a dose of sanity. In Italy, where memories of the euro crisis are still fresh and the government depends on EU-level budget approval for access to support from the European Central Bank (ECB), Ms Meloni is running a tight fiscal ship.

But in the event of a euro-crisis, populism will redouble the peril. Today the ECB is in all but name the lender of last resort to governments. Markets have implicit faith in the vow of Mario Draghi, a former ECB president, to do “whatever it takes” to keep the euro area together, so long as governments show what a former official has termed “macroeconomic reasonability”. When the covid-19 pandemic hit, the bloc had enough unity to put together fiscal insurance in the form of a recovery fund.

Would that still be true if President Marine Le Pen or Jordan Bardella were running a National Rally (RN) government in France? In a euro-zone crisis national governments would have to work with each other and the ECB at all-night summits. The markets would harshly punish any dithering or division. For decades, the answer to every crisis has been “more Europe”. Recent crises have led to common bank supervision and the issuance of joint bonds. Such solutions would be hard to stomach for parties that promised their voters “less Europe”. You do not have to be George Soros to predict that bond investors will test the euro zone’s cohesion if the RN is elected.

All this may seem speculative. But its shadow hangs over the economy even today, because many mainstream politicians are unwilling or unable to

pursue reforms for fear that they will provide ammunition to their rivals. Last year Mr Draghi unveiled a host of recommendations designed to boost Europe’s economy, including integrating the continent’s financial markets and many ways to cut red tape. Those proposals have gone precisely nowhere.

Europe’s politicians are in a bind. Change would make them unpopular, austerity would burnish the hard right’s extravagant promises, but caution, however tempting, perpetuates the rot that corrodes voters’ trust in politics. The Economist does not underestimate the courage it will take to pursue bold change. But the miserable, defeatist alternative is to surrender the initiative to the hard right. ■
