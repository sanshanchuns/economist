Blood and Treasure. By Duncan Weldon. Pegasus Books; 320 pages; $32. Abacus; £25A study of the economics of conflict, from the Vikings to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, by a former writer for and occasional contributor to The Economist. Time and again, Duncan Weldon spots the invisible hand behind hostilities. “A delightfully quirky approach to military history,” thought the Spectator. An “enthralling and entertaining book”, said Foreign Affairs. The Economic Consequences of Mr Trump: What the Trade War Means for the World. By Philip Coggan. Profile Books; 144 pages; $11.95 and £7.99Our former Bartleby columnist explains how Donald Trump’s tariffs

will impose costs on domestic producers and consumers, alienate allies and distort business decision-making. The president misunderstands the world trading system, the author argues, and his policy will not bring back manufacturing jobs (which have been eliminated by technology). “Sharp, accessible and free from polemic”, said the Financial Times.

Economics: The Economist Guide. By Philip Coggan. Economist Books; 320 pages; $18 and £11.99A comprehensive guide to how the economy actually works for the general reader. Chapters cover fiscal policy, monetary policy, trade and productivity. The book includes an A-Z of economic terms, which will help anyone baffled by economists’ fondness for jargon.

The Economist Quiz Book: 60 Brain Teasers for Inquisitive Minds. By Tom Standage. Economist Books; 320 pages; $18 and £10.99Our deputy editor— called “the Father Christmas of knowledge” by Giles Coren, a British journalist—compiles 60 quirky brain teasers inspired by the best minds at The Economist. The puzzles are designed to “probe your ability to find hidden connections, get the facts right and identify misinformation”.

The Land Trap: A New History of the World’s Oldest Asset. By Mike Bird. Portfolio; 336 pages; $32. Hodder Press; £25Stocks, bonds, crypto and currencies may capture daily attention, but land is the oldest asset, and one of the most important. Our Wall Street editor traces land’s development as a financial asset and explains why it is at the centre of political and financial crises. “One of those books that changes the way you see the world,” said Ed Conway of Sky News. “A thoroughly enjoyable tour of land’s importance in economic history to this day,” said the Financial Times.

Underdogs: The Truth About Britain’s White Working Class. By Joel Budd. Picador; 336 pages; £20Our social-affairs editor describes a group that is much talked about but little understood. This book argues that white working-class people are driving change in Britain, not just digging in against it. The Guardian found it “not just well-timed but admirably powerful”. “Essential reading”, said the Telegraph. ■
