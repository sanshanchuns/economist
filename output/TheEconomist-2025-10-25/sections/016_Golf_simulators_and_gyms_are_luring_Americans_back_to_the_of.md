Almost three decades ago, the American white-collar experience was captured—or at least parodied—by the film “Office Space”. In it, workers at a software firm struggle through thick traffic to get to a suburban box, where they toil in cubicles in a windowless expanse of badly carpeted grey. The printers don’t work, the corner offices are occupied by arrogant bosses, and everyone dreams of escape at 5pm. Nowadays, the work may be no less grinding, but the spaces are far fancier. Visit Hudson’s, a new building in Detroit, and you get a sense of what firms feel they must offer. In the centre of the building a grand atrium, filled with natural light, is a spot where people can grab lunch. Adjoining is a sort of

club room lined with bookshelves and plush armchairs. And next to that is perhaps the silliest perk of all: an indoor pickleball court. The tenants will also have access to a fully equipped gym and a golf simulator that cost at least $10,000.

Such amenities are far from rare in new buildings these days. An office development in Houston, Wells Fargo Plaza, has an arcade with table football, air hockey and vintage video games. In New York City, 1333 Broadway, in Midtown, has a rooftop bar with cabanas and “stunning, unobstructed views of the iconic Empire State Building”. Other buildings come with full-service food courts, yoga studios and even—somewhat more practically, at least for working parents—day-care centres.

According to Jeff Eckert, of JLL, a consultancy, demand for this sort of “amenity space” has been growing for ten years. But it accelerated during the pandemic. He cites a building in Denver he recently visited that had a grand roof terrace with firepits and a view of the Rocky Mountains, as well as a half-sized basketball court. “You walk in and you’re like, ‘Am I in a five-star hotel?’” he says. The goal is to get employees who got used to working from home in their pyjamas to come into the office.

Will the boom fade as more and more employers order their staff to come back into work, whether or not they fancy a game of pickleball? For now, Mr Eckert says not. Though a fifth of office space in America remains vacant, according to JLL’s estimates, vacancy rates in the fanciest buildings are far smaller, he says. This year, for the first time since 2019, more office space has filled up than emptied across the country. In some markets, such as New York City and San Francisco, offices are quickly filling up again. Not every firm wants amenities. Smaller companies with smaller budgets are returning to older “b-class offices”. The pickleball courts are in but if the economy slows sharply, the grey cubicles may yet return. ■
