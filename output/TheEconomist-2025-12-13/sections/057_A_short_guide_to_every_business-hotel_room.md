Welcome to the Marryattilton Hotel. We’re delighted that you have chosen to spend time with us, and look forward to making your stay as enjoyable as possible. We offer an entirely commoditised experience which somehow manages to be part of the attraction. Please do take a few minutes to read the following notes. • Guests must check out at midday. If you wish to extend your stay, please just let us know and we will happily charge you a lot extra.• The WiFi password is your room number. You will see a warning that your messages may not be securely protected. Please wonder briefly if you should

take this warning seriously and then ignore it.• We have given you two room cards even though you are clearly on your own. Make sure to carry them both around with you so that if you do lose one, you will be sure to lose both. • You have two complimentary bottles of water. Your name will be displayed on the TV screen when you turn it on. For some reason both of these things will make you feel well treated. • Some of our larger rooms come with a bowl of fruit. You would not be excited by the sight of a grape at home. Here you will see it as a mark of very high status.• You have two flannels, four handtowels and eight large towels. If you need more towels, you’re almost certainly doing something wrong.• Our amenities include an origami masterclass in your bathroom. The loose end of your toilet roll will be laboriously folded into a swan each morning. The flannels will be shaped into bows. The large towels will be rolled so tightly that this creates a vacuum. • All our carpets have been specially designed to make you feel dizzy. • The windows may or may not be see-through. You’ll be able to judge by the behaviour of the office workers across the street from you. • We have given you 20 times as many pillows as you need. Please do not attempt to use them all. It would be like sleeping standing up.• The sheets will be tucked so aggressively under the mattress that it will take you several minutes of intense effort to ram your legs down the length of the bed. Please do not try to create more room by kicking out furiously. You will only do yourself an injury.• All your drinking glasses will be wearing little paper hats.• We take extra care to make the corridors as featureless as possible, so that you have maximum difficulty finding your way back to the lifts.• You have the use of an extremely large, white dressing gown. Please wear it just because it is there.• For people under the age of 25, that thing on your bedside table is a landline phone. Simply dial “0” and no one will pick up. These phones are also placed on a table beside the lifts on each floor, where they must never be used. • We are committed to using entirely unnecessary packaging. Unwrapping the soap will require both time and incredible determination. • There is a safe in the wardrobe. Do not use it. It is not safe.• Sockets are available everywhere throughout the room except close to the desk where you want to work.• To add a bit of fun to your stay, we always have one light that refuses to turn off no matter which switches you press. • All our rooms come with two sets of curtains as standard. One for you, and one for your non-existent companion. • Breakfast is served from 6am. Our scrambled eggs are made of rubber. Our bacon is extremely brittle and will shatter if you apply any pressure. Cereals are available by slowly turning the handle on a dispenser for 20 minutes. If you are tempted to complain,

remember that you can go back for more. • The air conditioning has two modes: silent and jet-engine take-off. • If you try to get up in the middle of the night and find that you cannot move, do not panic. You are not paralysed; it’s just those sheets again. • If you ask someone at reception for restaurant recommendations they will ask if you would like a map. Despite the fact you have a device in your pocket that can guide you to a point anywhere on the planet, you should say “yes”. • A coffee machine is located above the fridge. It takes roughly 30 minutes to make it work. The results are disgusting.

Once again, thank you for choosing the Marryattilton. If you have any other questions, please just dial “0”. We hope you enjoy your stay.■
