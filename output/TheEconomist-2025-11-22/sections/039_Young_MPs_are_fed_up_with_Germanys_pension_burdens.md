JOHANNES WINKEL used to be a huge fan of Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor. At 2019’s annual gathering of the Junge Union (JU), the youth organisation of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), its sister party, he distributed posters saying “More Sauerland for Germany”. (Sauerland is Mr Merz’s home region.) Today Mr Winkel is the JU’s head and a member of parliament, and he has backed Mr Merz through thick and thin. Until now. Last weekend, at this year’s JU gathering, Mr Winkel demanded that Mr Merz change a draft pension-reform law that has already been approved by his cabinet. He says the draft law will incur added cumulative

costs of €120bn ($139bn) between 2032 and 2040, because it treats a temporary bolstering of pensions until 2031 as a benchmark for future levels. The coalition agreement struck in April between the CDU/CSU and the Social Democrats (SPD) promised to keep pensions at 48% of the average monthly salary (they would otherwise fall to 47%), but only until 2031. Mr Winkel and 17 other young MPs vowed to vote against the draft law, which they argue unfairly burdens the young. Some 20 older MPs might join the rebellion. Mr Merz has a majority of only 12 in the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament.

Mr Merz was planning to push the bill through in December. It also includes an “active” pension (a tax break aimed at encouraging pensioners to work longer) and an expansion of the Mütterrente, a benefit mostly claimed by mothers to compensate parents for years spent raising children. The SPD rejects any modification of the draft bill. On November 18th Bärbel Bas, the SPD labour minister who wrote it, said that the JU needs to decide whether it wants the government to fail.

This looks like the coalition’s most serious conflict since Mr Merz became chancellor in May. He had promised to push through reforms this autumn. “All the disappointment over Merz’s failure to deliver an ‘autumn of reforms’ is expressed in this rebellion,” says Moritz Schularick, head of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

Could Mr Merz stay in power without the SPD? On November 17th the embattled chancellor said that going ahead with a minority government would be “out of the question”. It would probably require him to rely periodically on support from the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a xenophobic populist-right party. This is unacceptable for Mr Merz, who staunchly defends the firewall that his and other German parties have maintained to exclude the AfD from government.

Mr Merz has several options for dodging the threat to his coalition. He could simply postpone the vote on the draft bill, thereby kicking the can down the road a bit. He could assign Jens Spahn, the head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, to negotiate concessions from the SPD, such as amending the draft law to remove the guarantee of pension levels beyond 2031. The Social Democrats, however, do not seem to be in a giving mood.

Lastly, Mr Merz could try to placate the mutineers, perhaps by including Mr Winkel and Pascal Reddig, another CDU rebel, on a pension committee that is to present a more comprehensive reform next year.

The pension protesters certainly have a point. Even Jens Südekum, an academic who advises Lars Klingbeil, the SPD finance minister, says that using the 48% level as the basis for calculations beyond 2031 is financially “hardly manageable”. Next year the federal government plans to spend a quarter of its total budget of €525bn on state pensions.

In the early 1960s there were six German workers for every German pensioner. Today the ratio is two to one, and the demography keeps deteriorating. Statutory pension contributions, split between employer and employee, have risen to 18.6% of salaries, and are on course to increase still more. The chancellor conceded at the JU’s gathering that the additional burden on the younger generation cannot be justified. But he is a hostage to the frailty of his coalition, which he has little choice but to keep alive at all costs. ■
