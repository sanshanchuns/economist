DONALD TRUMP took to Truth Social hours before meeting South Korea’s new president on August 25th. He accused Lee Jae Myung’s left- wing government of purging its conservative opponents: “WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA?” Mr Lee’s advisers feared they might be heading for a “Zelensky moment” in the Oval Office. Yet Mr Lee kept his cool, starting by praising the president for his gilded renovation of the White House. Mr Trump’s tone quickly changed: “We’re going to get along great,” he declared. The summit capped a deft diplomatic debut for Mr Lee, who took office in early June after the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol. The

new president had little experience overseas: he grew up impoverished, became a labour activist and rose through South Korean politics as a local official. He campaigned promising a pragmatic foreign policy, but critics doubted he would follow through. So far, however, he is delivering.

Mr Lee’s trip began with a groundbreaking stop in Tokyo. As the leader of the opposition Democratic Party (DP), Mr Lee slammed Mr Yoon for pursuing a rapprochement with Japan; DP administrations tend to be confrontational with South Korea’s former colonial overlords. But in Tokyo Mr Lee endorsed closer co-operation between the neighbours; while he raised their bitter past, he did not dwell on it. He became the first South Korean leader to make Japan his first foreign destination since the two countries normalised relations in 1965.

Mr Lee probably felt confident doing so because of big shifts in public opinion at home. Some 63% of South Koreans now have favourable views of Japan, up from a nadir of 12% in 2020. South Korea and Japan also share challenges, from demographic change to aggressive neighbours. Mr Lee said his meeting with Ishiba Shigeru, Japan’s prime minister, ran longer than planned because the two were discussing how to negotiate with their increasingly unpredictable ally, America.

Mr Lee arrived in Washington well-versed in the art of dealing with Mr Trump. He lauded the president for overseeing a manufacturing “renaissance” and a booming stockmarket. He came bearing gifts, including a custom-made golf putter, taking a page from the book of Abe Shinzo, Japan’s former prime minister, who used a set of gold-plated clubs to charm Mr Trump. When Mr Trump took a liking to Mr Lee’s fountain pen, the South Korean leader handed that over, too.

On substance Mr Lee also delivered lots of goodies. In a speech at a think- tank in Washington, he pledged to spend more on defence and declared that South Korea would no longer rely on America for security and on China for economic prosperity—a practice Trump administration officials have condemned. South Korean business leaders announced big investments: Korean Air pledged to buy 103 new jets from Boeing, its largest-ever order. Mr Lee also stopped in Philadelphia to highlight his country’s support for

reviving America’s dilapidated shipbuilding industry. South Korea has dubbed the effort MASGA: Make American Shipbuilding Great Again.

Mr Lee did not come away empty-handed. Mr Trump, for now, backed off talk of withdrawing American troops from South Korea. Mr Lee asked Mr Trump to help revive talks with North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong Un, musing about playing golf at a Trump Tower in North Korea in the future. South Korea has also managed to open discussions about allowing it to enrich and reprocess nuclear fuel. South Korean officials insist such capabilities are needed to strengthen their civil nuclear industry—but they would also make it much easier for the country to assemble nuclear weapons of its own. (America, worried about proliferation, has blocked South Korea from having that capacity.)

Beyond the bonhomie, plenty of stumbling blocks remain. Though South Korea concluded a deal with America that will see its tariff rate set at 15% (the same level as Japan), the details remain unsettled. Just days after Mr Lee left Washington, America announced new restrictions on South Korean chipmakers’ operations in China. While leaning closer to America, Mr Lee nonetheless hopes to continue balancing between the two superpowers— while he was at the White House, he quietly dispatched special envoys to Beijing, bearing an invitation to Xi Jinping to attend a summit of Asian leaders to be held in South Korea in late October. The true tests of Mr Lee’s pragmatism still lie ahead. ■
