Chopping down rainforests is daft. The social costs of clearing a typical patch of Brazilian Amazon are perhaps 30 times the benefits of rearing cows on it, by one estimate from 2023. The problem is, those costs, which include aggravating climate change, are spread across the entire world’s population, whereas the profits from cutting down the trees go to the men commanding the chainsaws. Somehow, the world has to find a way to make conservation pay. Its failure to do so is visible from space. Some 67,000km2 of virgin rainforest were destroyed last year, an area roughly the size of Ireland and nearly twice as much as was cleared in 2023. A pledge made by world

leaders at the COP climate conference in 2021 to halt deforestation by 2030 is nowhere close to being fulfilled: despite fluctuations, the pace of global deforestation is roughly the same as it was at the beginning of the decade.

Last year’s losses across the tropics added 3.1bn tonnes of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, more than India added by burning fossil fuels. What is more, deforestation can trigger a vicious feedback loop. Emissions raise temperatures, which parches vegetation, which leads to wildfires (which were the biggest driver of deforestation in 2024), which cause yet more emissions. The harm can be local as well as global. Rainforests create their own weather systems: evaporation from the canopy forms “flying rivers” that water farmland thousands of kilometres away. Conservationists fear that the Amazon is close to a tipping point, where this water-recycling system breaks down, accelerating the destruction of the forest. This year’s COP, which will be held in Brazil next month, will be fraught.

Yet there is hope. Though Brazil lost more rainforest than any other country last year, due to to wildfires, it also shows how better policy can make a difference. Under Jair Bolsonaro, a right-winger who was president from 2019 to 2023, little effort was made to halt the chainsaws. By contrast his successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and a flinty environment minister, Marina Silva, wield a judicious mix of stick and carrot. Heavily armed federal agents arrest illicit loggers and blow up illegal mines. Properties on which unlawful deforestation occurs are blacklisted for subsidised credit. The pace of deforestation fell by 80% during Lula’s first terms (2003-11), and fell again when he returned in 2023, before the wildfires set things back.

The political picture in Brazil is still positive. Whereas Mr Bolsonaro saw environmentalism as an obstacle to development, Lula’s government knows that destroying the rainforest would cripple Brazilian agriculture. It is trying harder to protect indigenous reserves, the inhabitants of which are usually good stewards of the forest, and to clarify property rights in the Amazon, which are a mess of overlapping and poorly documented claims. If you know who owns a piece of land, you know whom to punish for despoiling it or reward for conserving it. Happily, as digital-imaging technology advances, transgressions can be detected and reported within days, allowing authorities to react quickly.

All these lessons should be applied in other countries with rainforests. Unfortunately, many are far worse-governed than Brazil. The Democratic Republic of Congo introduced a land-use law this year that aims to protect indigenous groups, but Congo’s government has only shaky control over its own territory. Some local cash-for-conservation schemes show promise. However, the main thing protecting Congo’s vast forests is its dire lack of roads. If these improve faster than the rule of law, loggers may run amok.

Since preserving rainforests is a global public good, the world should help pay for it. But again, this is easier said than done. Rich countries have soured on aid. Markets for carbon credits have failed to take off, partly because it is hard to tell whether money given to conservation projects actually conserves trees. The simplest method would be payments to governments of countries (or provinces) where deforestation stops, as verified by satellite images. Brazil is striving to drum up interest in this idea. However, if the governments in question are corrupt or repressive, donors may have qualms. The struggle to save the world’s lungs will require creativity, diplomacy and clear-sightedness.■
