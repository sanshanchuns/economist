UNLIKE THEIR French neighbours, Britons tend to be sniffy about eating snails. But there is a new fad involving the delectable gastropods that Brits do have a taste for: tax avoidance. The scheme is both slimy and simple. When a commercial property is vacated a landlord becomes liable for its taxes, known as business rates. To avoid them (a 5,000-square-foot office in central London might owe £12,000, or $16,000, a month), some landlords turn their offices into “farms”. Boxes of live snails are purchased at £14 each and the property is claimed to be an agricultural unit—exempt from business rates.

Urban snail farms are seen by local authorities and the courts as a sham. One venture in Liverpool had 15 boxes with as few as two snails each. Adam Hug of Westminster City Council says it is hard to stop such behaviour because the schemes are run by agents hiding behind shell companies. After a court finds the “farm” illegitimate, the business simply declares itself insolvent and the tax liability must be written off.

A cottage industry of advisers exists to minimise business rates. When a property is vacated, landlords can claim 90 days of empty-property relief (epr) from business rates. A loophole allows landlords to then store empty boxes (or any other item) in their property for a six-week period of “occupation”; after which they can claim another 90 days of epr. By doing this over 12 months they can reduce their tax liabilities by 75%.

To discourage this “box shifting”, last year the government extended the eligibility period for EPR from six to 13 weeks. In recent years schemes claiming full business-rate relief as “places of worship” have proliferated. The owners of a science park in rural Kent with a £1m annual liability says —to the incredulity of the local authority—that all 60 of the units are now, in effect, houses of god.

Landlords have easier ways to reduce their taxes. astop, a social enterprise, matches landlords to legitimate charities that take temporary rent-free occupation of properties when they fall vacant. Charities then claim 80% business-rate relief on the landlords’ behalf.

The government says it wants to devise a “fairer” system “fit for the 21st century”. Schemes to avoid business rates have serious repercussions. The annual £24bn (0.8% of GDP) tax yield from commercial property is lower than in earlier years, as landlords and their tenants take advantage of exemptions (many legitimately). Westminster City Council will rake in £2bn from business rates this year, but 95% of it is sent to the Treasury, which disburses it around the country. A tax-dodging snail farm in Marylebone can affect social-care budgets in Middlesbrough.■
