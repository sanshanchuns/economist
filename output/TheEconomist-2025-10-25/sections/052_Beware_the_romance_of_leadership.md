Zohran Mamdani is a very good campaigner. At a rally in Washington Heights this month, the Democratic nominee to become mayor of New York City conducts a call-back of his main policy pledges. “We’re going…freeze the…,” he begins. “Rent!” shouts the enthusiastic crowd. “Buses should be fast and…” “Free!” “All shall have…” “Prizes!” (This last one is made up.) A clear political offer is likely to propel Mr Mamdani to victory in the mayoral election in November. But leading a campaign is one thing. Making the sums add up in office is quite another. The context will require something different from him.

Spend time among the artificial-intelligence pioneers of San Francisco, and you’ll also hear the word “context” a lot. Frontier models are great at providing generic answers, but specific expertise is often needed to make them useful. “General foundation models are trained on mostly internet data originally,” says Sarah Guo, the founder of Conviction, a venture-capital firm. “When I consult with my doctor about a medical case for myself or my child, I don’t want them getting information that includes Reddit.”

To yield the best results inside organisations, AI applications need to be trained on relevant data, embedded in actual workflows and checked by people with experience. To be effective they need to fit the context.

What is true of politicians and AI models is true of bosses, too. The importance of context to managers may sound obvious but it is often ignored. Gary Johns of Concordia University in Montreal attributes this blind spot to the “romance of leadership”, the idea that the innate qualities of individuals at the top determine success or failure far more than the environment in which they operate. In fact, reality is as likely to distort you as the other way round.

Crises change the way people manage, for example. A study by Janka Stoker of the University of Groningen and her colleagues used subordinates’ assessments of their managers to see the effect of the financial crisis of 2007-09 on 20,000 bosses across 36 countries. They found that leaders became more directive, even though this is not necessarily the best response. Another form of context, national culture, helped determine just how bossy they became. They were more hands-on in countries that are used to hierarchy, less so in consultative places.

The external environment shapes managers in more subtle ways, too. A study by Daniel Keum and Stephan Meier of Columbia Business School found that expansions in unemployment-insurance schemes in America were correlated with more lay-offs. A more generous welfare state apparently gave bosses greater licence to dismiss people.

Leadership qualities are often context-dependent. Caring for others is a generally desirable attribute in a boss, for instance, but sometimes a harder edge is needed. In their study of lay-offs, Messrs Keum and Meier also

analysed the preferences of the chief executives wielding the knife. Kinder- hearted CEOs let more people go when such schemes became more generous, suggesting that they had been putting off necessary restructuring.

The value of charisma is also contingent. It undoubtedly has the capacity to rouse people to greater effort. In an experiment conducted by John Antonakis of the University of Lausanne and his co-authors, people who heard a motivational speech before starting out on a task increased their output by 17% compared with people who got a bog-standard, low-wattage address. This effect was roughly the same as that of being offered performance-related pay.

But research suggests that charisma can be unnecessary among people who like to work autonomously. Another study co-written by Ms Stoker found that when senior leadership teams are adept at directing themselves, an inspirational boss has far less impact. Sometimes the soapbox is superfluous.

Good bosses do not bend with the wind. But they do adapt to their environments. A multinational workforce means multiple cultural norms: some nationalities are happier to speak truth to power, and others need to be encouraged. Projects ebb and flow: sometimes a leader needs to step in and sometimes they need to step back. When Mr Mamdani won the Democratic nomination in June, he got a call from Barack Obama. The two spoke about the transition to governing. Congratulations—and context. ■
