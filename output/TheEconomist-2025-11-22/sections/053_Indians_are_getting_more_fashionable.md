IT WOULD BE a stretch ever to describe Mumbai’s Hill Road as deserted. But the shopping street does look a bit less packed lately. Business has not been the same since the pandemic, says Sheikh Aziz, who along with his brother runs a pair of shops selling children’s and women’s garments for between 250 and 350 rupees ($3-4). They blame the internet. “Why should people spend money on a rickshaw to come here when they get whatever they want sitting at home?” he says. Every Indian city has at least one district dedicated to inexpensive, unbranded clothing, filled with small traders like Mr Aziz, who form the backbone of Indian markets. Four-fifths of India’s $1trn in retail spending

last year—and three-fifths of the $100bn spent on fashion—took place in shops and stalls like his.

That started to change with the pandemic. A mobile-broadband boom some years earlier had caused the price of data to plummet; so a bored country used its spare time to explore online shopping. E-commerce platforms doubled their share of the fashion market to nearly 15% between 2019 and 2024, according to HSBC, a bank. That is still well below China and America, where 40% of fashion is purchased online. But it is growing fast.

Driving the shift are companies like Meesho, an e-commerce platform backed by SoftBank, a Japanese tech investor. The number of people buying goods on the platform in the past 12 months hit 199m this year, up from 2m in 2020. Last month the company filed paperwork to go public at a hoped- for valuation of $7bn-8bn. Though it is just one of several platforms dedicated to fashion, which include Walmart-owned Myntra, it is the one that competes most directly with Mr Aziz. Shoppers can get hold of a sari at the rock-bottom price of 266 rupees—including delivery.

The three-dollar sari illustrates two big shifts occurring in the Indian marketplace. The first is structural. Platforms like Meesho are dragging small Indian businesses—which is most of them—away from the inefficient, unorganised market and into the formal economy. Five years ago 85% of Indian retail was informal. By 2030 the share is likely to fall to around 66- 68%, according to Meesho’s prospectus.

The second shift has to do with market size. E-commerce platforms open up new opportunities for vendors, expanding their horizons from a neighbourhood to the entire country. Amazon and Myntra mostly cater to big cities. But at Meesho’s prices, says an analyst, the market is in effect “unlimited”. Meesho is attractive to small sellers because it does not take a commission and instead charges fees for delivery and advertising. That allows it to keep costs low and take market share from street vendors, rather than competing with e-commerce rivals. Amazon and Myntra have recently launched low-cost fashion arms.

The corollary of a bigger market for sellers is an expansion in customer choice. “What has changed in the past four-five years is access,” says Joseph

Sebastian of Blume, a venture-capital firm. Back then shoppers had to travel to urban centres or market towns “because there was nothing around you where you can spend”, says Avi Mehta of Macquarie, a bank. India’s unreliable postal system and incomprehensible addresses made e-commerce delivery uneconomic. But the rise of startups such as Delhivery, a firm built around a weak pun, as well as the in-house logistics arms of the big e- commerce platforms, has made it possible to send goods to the most remote parts of India. Nine in ten of Meesho’s shoppers live outside of the country’s eight biggest cities.

Taken together, these shifts hint at a change that transcends business and transforms society more broadly. Social media and e-commerce have boosted the aspirations and consumption of small towns. Mr Sebastian, who grew up in a small town in Kerala called Kattappana and now lives in Bangalore, says he can see the change when he returns. In his youth big-city trends would reach his town years later. Now, he says, “young people there look a lot like young people in Koramanagala,” a hip corner of Bangalore. ■
