Soon, shoplifters in America may not just have to watch behind them, but above their heads, too. Flock Safety, a company that builds drones, has developed systems to pursue thieves bolting from retail stores or intruders at factory sites. With a press of a button at an offsite security hub, says Rahul Sidhu, Flock’s vice-president for aviation, a retailer’s officers could instruct drones to leave their docks and follow suspects until police arrive. To many Americans, this may sound like more drone hype. More than a decade has passed since Amazon unveiled Prime Air, stoking expectations of unmanned flying vehicles zipping packages to homes. But the company only last year got a federal special regulatory waiver permitting it to operate

drones beyond the operators’ line of sight. Though the retailer boasts that it now delivers packages weighing up to 5lb (2.3kg) to customers in two cities and is expanding in several others, its ubiquitous blue-grey electric vans and cargo bikes remain much more noticeable in most American cities.

Despite years of promises, America’s “low-altitude economy” is still largely theoretical, even as China’s advances. China’s regulators have been more permissive; those in America must worry more about public backlash and the demands of the many private aircraft pilots operating in low-altitude airspace. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is still mulling how to relax restrictions on drone flights that extend beyond the operators’ view, as the most tantalising applications require.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in June ordering them to speed up. The faa responded in August with new proposed rules on flights beyond an operator’s line of sight. To date, companies such as Amazon seeking to fly drones beyond their visual range have had to get bespoke waivers from the federal government. Under the new regime, they would still need federal approvals, but the government wants its standards to be clear, uniform and feasible.

Drone flights would be forbidden over outdoor public gatherings and above 400 feet (122 metres) in most cases. Operators would have to buy drones capable of flying without visual supervision, but, as long as it met spec, each drone leaving a production line would need only testing, not a federal airworthiness certification.

More cheap drones that are allowed to travel far could do much good. Clinics could dispatch patients’ blood for rapid lab testing. Farmers could engage in precision agriculture, in which drones spray specific amounts of pesticide and fertiliser in different parts of a field. Bridge, power-line and railway maintenance could become easier and safer.

Enabling such uses is the government’s intention, but everyone from drone- builders to hot-air balloonists has complained about its plan. Conflict is especially fierce over how to prevent mid-air crashes in low-altitude airspace. The final shape of these rules, after regulators have absorbed all the comments, will decide the pace and scale of drone activity in America.

Pilots of helicopters and other aircraft say that drones should always give way to manned vehicles, as is the practice now. A “drone carrying a burrito” is nimbler than a crewed hot-air balloon, says Bailey Wood of Vertical Aviation International, an industry group. Yet when manned aircraft do not have “conspicuity” electronics that broadcast their presence—not all of them must—simple drones might not know they should avoid them.

Drone-industry representatives warn that requiring lots of safety hardware, such as multiple types of aircraft-avoidance technology, would make drones more complex to build and operate, reducing their usefulness. Perhaps all aircraft in low-altitude airspace should be obliged to broadcast a location signal that warns off drones and anything else, as some industry advocates suggest.

“Just make it a requirement that drones have to give right-of-way to all conspicuous aircraft, and all aircraft operating below 500 feet need to be conspicuous,” says Liz Forro, policy director of the Commercial Drone Alliance, an industry group. Doing this would, indeed, be simpler than the government’s current plan, and requiring conspicuity kit on manned aircraft seems a small price to pay to ensure that the drone business takes off and the skies remain safe. If American regulators get their rules right—they have until early next year to refine their proposal—a new era of American commerce may yet arrive to the faint whirr of overhead drones. ■
