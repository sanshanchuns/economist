After Chatgpt was launched in 2022, generative artificial intelligence (ai) quickly came to be seen as an existential threat to the search business of Google, owned by Alphabet. It has turned out to be the firm’s saviour—at least in one sense. On September 2nd Amit Mehta, a federal judge who last year declared Google an illegal monopolist, rejected the government’s demand that the search giant be torn apart, and delivered it the gentlest of punishments. The reason was ai. It “changed the course of this case”, he said. In one of the biggest antitrust climbdowns since Microsoft was spared a breakup in 2001, Mr Mehta acquiesced to the meek remedies proposed by Google. He said that the Department of Justice had “overreached” in calling

for the divestment of Google’s Chrome browser and Android operating system.

Although he banned Google from signing exclusive deals for the distribution of some products including Chrome, Google Search and the Gemini app, an ai assistant, he allowed payments to its partners to continue, to avoid potentially “crippling” harm to companies that rely on them. That was a big reprieve for Apple, too, which has received tens of billions of dollars a year for making Google its default search engine.

Shares of Alphabet soared after the decision. Apple’s rose as well. The ruling eased the uncertainty that has hung over both companies all year, at a time when valuations of big-tech peers have increased sharply. It may even encourage the forging of closer ties between the two firms. Some speculate that Apple will partner with Google, running the latter’s Gemini ai products on the iPhone.

All the same, it was not unalloyed good news for Google. In an effort to encourage more competition in the search market, which the company still dominates, the ruling requires Google to share user-interaction and other search-related data with smaller competitors. Google is still expected to appeal against the original verdict that declared it a monopolist, noting that “competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want”. Moreover, it faces the risk that it may shortly have to sell some parts of its advertising business if a second antitrust trial goes against the company.

But Mr Mehta wrote that, since last year, when he found Google liable for illegal behaviour, ai has brought big changes to the search market. He noted that hundreds of billions of dollars had flown into startups to create generative-ai products that could disrupt established search businesses such as Google’s. Chatbots like Openai’s Chatgpt, Anthropic’s Claude and Perplexity are being used widely for search-like functions. During hearings about the proposed remedies earlier this year, Eddy Cue, an executive at Apple, testified that the volume of Google search queries on Apple’s Safari browser had declined for the first time in 22 years. “There are strong reasons not to jolt the system and to allow market forces to do the work,” the judge pointed out.

Google will be greatly relieved. Despite the verdict, it has emerged largely unscathed from the biggest tech antitrust case in a quarter of a century. In another reprieve, on September 1st a fine it was due to receive from the European Commission for breaching antitrust rules over its ad-tech practices was reportedly delayed. That appears to be related to the to-and-fro over tariff negotiations between America and the European Union.

Not so long ago, America’s tech giants looked like they were vulnerable to a “techlash”. Thanks to generative ai, they are now getting most of the breaks. ■
