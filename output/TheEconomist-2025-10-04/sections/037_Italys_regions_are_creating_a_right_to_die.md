ITALY’S REGIONS are fomenting a quiet rebellion on the contentious issue of the right to die. In September Sardinia became the second of them, after Tuscany, to approve a new regional law regulating medically assisted suicide. Umbria is expected to follow soon. The moves come after a ruling in 2019 by Italy’s constitutional court that in effect legalised doctor-assisted suicide under certain conditions, but urged parliament to legislate on the issue. The hard-right national government is attempting to reassert control of the issue by introducing a bill, currently being debated in the Senate. A total of 11 people have been helped to commit suicide in Italy since the ruling, and polls suggest Italians generally support reform.

The ruling followed the death of Fabiano Antoniani, a music producer who was left tetraplegic and blind by a traffic accident. When Marco Cappato, a former MEP and right-to-die activist who accompanied him to Dignitas in Switzerland, was prosecuted for aiding suicide, the court ruled that the basis for charging him had been unconstitutional. It provided an exception for assisting those in unbearable and irreversible suffering, so long as they were fully capable of making decisions.

Despite that ruling, health authorities, particularly in right-controlled regions, have simply ignored assisted-dying requests in what Mr Cappato describes as “practical sabotage”. The approval of a law in Tuscany in February reignited the debate, by imposing a 30-day time-limit for health authorities to make a decision.

Catholics have pushed back. The Italian bishops’ association says such moves are “in radical contrast with the value of the human person”. And right-to-die campaigners say the government’s proposed law would unduly restrict access, as it would apply only to those on life-support machines and exclude any use of the public health system, making assisted dying available only to those who can afford private care.

The debate is a good example of how recent governments have often failed to tackle ethical issues, leaving civil society to find another route, as also on gay rights. It is precisely this outcome that Giorgia Meloni’s government is seeking to avoid. But despite a big majority, success for the bill is far from assured. Important figures on the right such as Marina Berlusconi, the daughter of the late Silvio, who bankrolls Forza Italia, have expressed sympathy for the right-to-die cause. With a free vote and a secret ballot the result is uncertain.■
