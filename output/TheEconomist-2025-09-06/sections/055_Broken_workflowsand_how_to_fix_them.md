Very premature babies need lots of immediate medical attention. Which is why one neo-natal team in an American hospital texted the acronym “ELBW”, shorthand for “extremely low birth weight”, to relevant clinical staff if they wanted them to get to the unit fast. Unfortunately, some recipients of this message took it to mean that a baby had a problem with its elbow, and did not require an urgent response. This excruciating story is one of many told in a new book, “There’s Got To Be A Better Way”, by Nelson Repenning, a business-school professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Donald Kieffer, a one-time operations executive at Harley- Davidson who also lectures at MIT.

The authors’ premise is that many of the processes which govern work within organisations are broken. Whether they are flawed from the outset or malfunction over time, they need constant monitoring and improvement. At the heart of the book is a simple instruction to managers: go and see how things actually work. “If you aren’t embarrassed by what you find,” they write, “you probably aren’t looking closely enough.”

Mr Repenning offers an example from one of his own classes: a lung- transplant surgeon in Boston who fell short of targets for the number of post- operative appointments he had. Investigating the problem turned up one unexpected issue: parking. Difficulties finding a spot meant delays rippled through the diary; a quick call the night before, offering advice on where to park, boosted the number who were seen.

The way people work around dysfunctional systems often causes problems to compound. When maintenance requests at one fuel-refining company got snarled up, for instance, operating managers realised that they could jump the queue by labelling it a “priority one” job. In theory, this designation meant a request had safety implications; in practice, it offered a useful short- cut for some that gummed things up for everyone else.

And before any managers read this and shake their heads in exasperation, they should look in the mirror. Jobs are constantly being reprioritised because one of the higher-ups wants something else done first. Bosses’ instincts to have people working at full pelt are another big problem: overload leads to bottlenecks, and bottlenecks lead to spirals of delays and workarounds. The most counterintuitive idea in the book, says Mr Repenning, is that cramming more work into a system is not going to lead to more output.

The approvals process for IT projects at Standard Chartered, a bank, used to take 120 days on average as different risk managers assessed each specific hazard in turn. Its chief operating officer instituted a weekly meeting that brought all the relevant people together to look at a rank-ordered backlog; a decision on the project at the top of the list would have to be made before the second one was considered. With everyone at the meeting focused on a small number of agreed projects each week, and with no chance for anyone to get their pet initiative early, everything accelerated. As a consequence of

this and some other changes, the average approval time dropped to only 20 days.

Much of the thinking in the book can be traced to the factories where Mr Kieffer made his career, and to one company in particular: Toyota and its restless mantra of continuous improvement. Manufacturing processes have the advantage of being very observable: if something is going badly wrong in a factory, there will probably be physical clues (loads of inventory, stopped assembly lines, a severed finger). But even when work is digital, it can still be visualised: old-fashioned tech such as whiteboards and Post-It notes can be used to show a workflow, to pinpoint problems and, crucially, to spark discussion.

Changing behaviour is hard. Bosses are busy, for one thing, and may balk at spending time observing processes in detail. But the spread of AI means that managers of all kinds now have good reason to re-examine their workflows. This refreshingly practical book suggests both that they will find all sorts of horrors when they look closely, and that a dose of common sense can solve as many problems as superintelligence. ■
