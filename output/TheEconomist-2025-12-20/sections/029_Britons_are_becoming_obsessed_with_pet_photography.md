AT A STUDIO in east London, Storm, a Maltipoo in a Christmas collar, nearly topples off a backdrop roll. Luckily the shoot is over, and her owner is thrilled with one image: Storm nose-to-nose with a large rabbit. It will sit neatly on her Instagram profile. That Britons—western Europe’s top dog-owners—like pet photos is no surprise. What is striking is how many they take.

Pet photography is not for the timid. Stoyo Gerov, who runs Pawshot Studios (and offers those cab rides), recalls working with a Czechoslovakian wolfdog called Wulrick.
