Few destinations in China are as laid-back as Dali, a south-western backpackers’ haven that has been nicknamed Dalifornia. Frazzled types retreat to its lakeside old town for the summer. They often hang around for months on a shoestring. By several accounts from restaurateurs, hoteliers and travel operators, the city’s tourist areas appeared busier this summer than ever before. One local merchant grumbles that too many visitors come only to bai piao, or freeload. Why is Dali so full? Rich urbanites, jolted by China’s continuing property crisis, are cautious about parting with cash. Many spend less than they did in the past on dining and travel, a phenomenon known as “consumer downgrading”. This might partly explain the town’s bustling streets and

teeming cafés. But there also seems to be another story unfolding. One reason such places are flush with bargain-hunting tourists is that less wealthy groups actually appear to be travelling more this year than they have in the past.

In the first half of 2025 Chinese travellers took 3.3bn domestic trips, up 20% from the same period last year. (Each ride on a plane or train is counted as one trip.) The total amount shelled out by these tourists surged by more than 15%. It was the first time travel spending in the first half of the year exceeded pre-pandemic levels. But digging into the numbers per trip, tourists spent 4.3% less than a year ago. On average, Chinese travellers are spending only slightly more per person now than they did in 2019. This can probably be explained by the addition of more lower-income travellers, reckons Joe Peissel of Trivium China, a Beijing-based consultancy.

Spending among different income groups is hard to disentangle in official Chinese data. But one finding from a recent consumer survey by Bank of America backs up the idea that lower-income households might be spending more of their disposable income. Some 54% of respondents making less than 100,000 yuan ($14,000) a year said they expected to increase their spending in the future, a leap from just 34% in June. This jump was bigger than in other income groups.

Who is spending, and where, has serious implications for China’s economy. People in smaller cities commonly face greater economic challenges than their big-city counterparts. And Chinese tend to save more in general than people in developed countries, owing to China’s weak social safety-net. Convincing them to part with excess savings could help unlock consumer demand and give the economy a much needed boost.

Consumer sentiment is in the dumps this year in China’s flashiest cities. But in poorer, smaller cities in China’s interior—home to vast numbers of people —the mood is brighter. (Close to 1bn Chinese live outside the main metropolises.) The average growth rate for retail spending in five small cities in Henan province, for example, was nearly 8% in the first half of the year. In Beijing in the same period it was -3.8%. Similarly, last year the cities where residents coughed up a lot of their disposable income—say

80%, versus the 60% which is more common in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai—tended to be small.

These are interesting trends, say economists. Although it is unsurprising that poorer people spend a larger share of their income, it is possible that their saving rate has dropped in a way that has not happened among the rich. It may also be the case that incomes are growing faster among the country’s poor.

One explanation for small-time splurging is a perceived improvement in China’s property crisis, which has dragged on for more than five years and which has sent home valuations plummeting. The rise in the willingness to spend among low-income people in August correlated with an improved outlook for residential property in China’s small cities, according to Anna Zhou, an economist at Bank of America. Whatever the causes turn out to be, catering to this group of consumers is becoming increasingly important in China.

Local governments outside mega-cities have been heavily promoting cheap travel options in recent years, notes Mr Peissel of Trivium. Their efforts appear to be paying off. Just look at Jiangsu province on the country’s eastern coast. It has promoted a local football league this year with tickets that sell for just ten yuan apiece; tourists looking for affordable fun have swarmed into the region. The lesson is clear. Cranky shop owners in Dali will need to embrace such low-spenders to thrive. ■
