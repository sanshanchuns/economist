EVEN AS WESTERN news outlets struggle to gain access to China, a crop of worldly Chinese writers offers what many crave: original insight into the country from bright journalists in the know. The Economist has identified over a dozen writers on Substack who are employed by China’s state media. Cumulatively, they have over 50,000 subscribers on the popular American online-blogging platform (which is home to thousands of writers and more than 5m paying readers). Some of its top newsletters contain interpretations of Chinese government decisions, translations of speeches and analysis for an elite audience—namely, Western diplomats, scholars and journalists. Certain writers disclose their government ties, but also insist that they are independent. Liu Yang, a staffer at Xinhua, the state news agency, says that

he is “moonlighting” when he writes his blog with more than 4,000 subscribers. Jiang Jiang, also of Xinhua, has more than 13,000 readers and writes that his work reflects his “personal views, not those of Xinhua”. Others, such as Li Jingjing, a star on China’s state television with about 5,000 readers on Substack, do not seem to disclose their government links prominently. The appeal of such writers is obvious; the degree to which they interact with the state’s propaganda machinery less so.

For all the talk of staff airing their personal views, their labours align well with a push by China’s rulers to reach foreign readers in more sophisticated ways. Freewheeling state-owned media outlets, such as Sixth Tone and Phoenix TV, emerged after similar initiatives in the past. Many newsletter readers are aware of the bloggers’ official ties, but are unsure how seriously to take assurances that, despite being state employees, they are not acting at the direction of the government. Such independence would be truly remarkable, given the Chinese Communist Party’s obsessive control of official narratives. (Substack did not respond immediately to requests for comment.)

Xi Jinping, China’s ruler, has often said that his country is engaged in a “struggle” for overseas public opinion. But the state’s media apparatus is slow and bureaucratic. Its risk-averse coverage leads many to tune out, and its unwavering praise for China’s leaders sees it dismissed overseas. In China and the West, individuals with online brands increasingly challenge mastheads for audience and influence.

In response the government has embraced a model which uses personal brands for party agendas, says David Bandurski of China Media Project, a research group. A recent report in Chinese Journalist, a trade magazine for state-media employees, describes how government-run outlets have created “media studios”—outfits run by individuals or small teams that obscure their state-media credentials. These may include certain state-sponsored writers. Mr Jiang’s newsletter, states the report (though this reference was later deleted), was “incubated within Xinhua’s External Affairs Department”, known officially as the Department of China News for World Service. Mr Jiang told The Economist his work “speaks for itself”.

It is possible that some bright young journalists choose to write for foreign audiences, with the blessing of superiors, because it is more professionally rewarding to do so. Certain entrepreneurial types may have started online blogs to gain promotion, only for their bosses to take credit for their ingenuity. From the state’s perspective, however, cloaking government media is a strategic coup. Xinhua currently has about 50 studios, according to the report, though Sean Haines, a British journalist who used to work for Chinese state media, estimates that there are more than 1,000 across the country aimed at domestic and foreign audiences.

Such studios offer three big benefits. They are nimble, targeted and trusted. Internally, media studios are known as “light cavalry”, as they are free from government bureaucracy (but not its editorial control) and can charge in quickly to influence the interpretation of news events. The idea is that, after building an organic audience through news analysis, media studios can push more controversial fare, such as one article on “Why Xinjiang’s labour transfer program ≠ forced labour”.

Newsletters are favoured by Western elites, Du Jian, a Xinhua official, has written. They enable a long-term strategy to “influence readers’ thoughts drop-by-drop” and establish a “benign mutual relationship”, he noted in another report for Chinese Journalist. His article was first analysed on Mr Haines’s own Substack, TooSimple, which investigates Chinese state media. Mr Jiang’s blog, the article continued, “targets elite subscribers in the United States” (this also appears to have been deleted).

Because they can ditch state media’s tainted reputation, says one Chinese academic, media studios are adept at “engaging in international public opinion struggles”. Unlike those with official backgrounds, the scholar argues, these influencers “can more freely and boldly engage” in such debates in ways that are “more easily accepted…by overseas audiences”.

Many China-watchers will welcome having more voices on the goings-on inside the country. Such mutual understanding also rests on transparency around the origins and intentions of those voices. Xu Zeyu was one of the first Xinhua personalities to be given a studio to cultivate foreign audiences, according to Xinhua’s own reporting. He has 3.9m followers on Facebook,

but is perhaps just as influential on his Substack, aptly named Sinical China, which has 9,000 readers.

He explained his vision of writing for foreign audiences on a state TV programme in 2021. “On this battlefield, I am also a fighter; the words under my pen and the lens in my hand are my weapons,” he said. He described his role differently to The Economist. “My work is to bridge the gap between foreign misconceptions and China’s realities,” he says. ■
