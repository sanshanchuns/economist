The American mortgage market is shrinking. After years of rising house prices and dwindling lending, the value of mortgage debt as a share of the housing stock is at its lowest in 60 years. To those who remember the global financial crisis, when troubled housing loans blew up the banks, this may sound like good news. In fact, it is a cause for concern. Many families are being needlessly locked out of homeownership. Labour mobility has slowed, as homeowners stay put. And because modest, single-family homes have fewer prospective buyers, fewer of those properties are being built. America’s mortgage market needs unclogging.

The surging interest rates of recent years are partly to blame. During the pandemic homeowners rushed to refinance at record-low interest rates. Now that rates are higher—the 30-year mortgage rate stands at 6.2%, compared with 2.7% in early 2021—they are loth to move. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has found that the lock-in caused by higher rates cut house sales by 1.7m between mid-2022 and mid-2024.

That is not the whole story. Mortgage activity was depressed long before rates began to rise, because of post-crisis regulation, especially for smaller loans and borrowers with average or below-average credit scores. Mortgage lending to those with credit scores of 760 and higher, above the average of 705, now accounts for two-thirds of the total, more than twice the prevailing share of just over two decades ago.

In response to the drought, the Trump administration has floated various ideas. One of them is a side-show. The president and Bill Pulte, the head of the fhfa, have both enthused about 50-year mortgages. But ultra-long loans would leave homebuyers paying off mortgages into retirement, and would worsen the lock-in effect when interest rates rise, gumming up the housing market further.

Mr Pulte also says the administration is studying portable mortgages, which are a better idea. Portable loans, which are common in countries including Britain and Canada, allow homeowners to take their mortgages with them when they move house. It could help ease the part of the problem caused by high interest rates, and boost mobility again.

More is needed to revive the market. After the financial crisis, lenders’ fees were capped, and standards for assessing a borrower’s ability to repay were tightened to the point that issuing loans would often be unprofitable. Many borrowers with less regular forms of income, such as freelance workers, are now locked out of the market. Even credit unions—hardly the ravenous capitalists of Wall Street—are calling for rules to be changed for loans below $100,000, which are now all but impossible to make.

At the same time, owner-friendly rules at the federal and state level mean that it now takes a lender 608 days to foreclose on a home, up from less than 200 in 2007. In some states such as New York the average repossession

takes over five years. Built-in waiting periods, lengthy court proceedings and mandated mediation have all helped struggling homeowners hang on to their properties for longer. But if lenders cannot repossess homes, they will treat mortgage debt as if it is unsecured, shutting many potential borrowers out of the market.

Ordinary borrowers with middling credit did little to cause the crash in 2007-09. But the rules introduced in its aftermath are punishing them, without making the financial system any safer. As the mortgage market shrinks ever further, now is the time to correct past mistakes. ■
