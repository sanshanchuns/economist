A dinner hosted by the London Metals Exchange every October is where “base” metals meet the West End. In a glitzy ballroom, 1,500 black-tied guests talk beneath chandeliers, take selfies on balustrades and clap at rusty jokes. At the VIP table, miners and ministers craft deals while sipping chardonnay. Bets are placed on how long the post-dinner show will last—a 20-minute rendition of “Mamma Mia!” featuring LME bosses, it turns out. Award winners go home with a bottle of fizz. Metal traders have reason to feel bubbly. The tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed on America’s aluminium, copper and steel imports have created vast arbitrage opportunities that they are busy exploiting. Copper, in

particular, has been on a tear; it is now priced above $10,600 a tonne in London, an 18-month high. Elevated prices have sparked a $50bn merger between Anglo American and Teck Resources, two giant miners. BHP, the world’s biggest, is considering reopening defunct mines. Even Saudi Aramco, an oilier firm, is hiring copper traders.

Yet the copper craze is strangely timed. The metal, long known as “Dr Copper” for its ability to diagnose economic conditions, should not be so perky at a time when the world’s economy, though resilient, is hardly surging. What is going on?

Three possible explanations stand out: prices could be buoyed by strong demand, scarce supply or economic policy beyond copper “fundamentals”. Start with demand. Investors who are bullish about copper draw attention to its role in the energy transition and the artificial-intelligence boom. An electric car needs two to four times more copper than a petrol one; the metal is also required in grids and wind turbines. This year new data centres are expected to eat up perhaps 300,000 tonnes of refined copper, or 1% of global output.

This case has been made for a while, however. At the party, analysts joked that the great copper crunch is always four or five years away. As new technologies mature, they often become more frugal: an electric car made in 2025 needs about 10% less copper than one built in 2020. Meanwhile, the usual engines of copper demand are stalling. China’s troubled economy is becoming less reliant on construction, which used to devour the stuff. That could free up 2m tonnes a year, reckons Tom Price of Panmure Liberum, a bank. He expects the world’s overall appetite to shrink, not surge, in what remains of this year.

Another possible reason for the price surge could be elusive supply. On September 8th a mudslide hit Indonesia’s Grasberg mine, the world’s second-largest. The facility remains shut; Freeport, its operator, does not expect full production to resume before 2027. The outage, together with disruptions in Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo, could remove 400,000 tonnes of refined copper supply in 2025. Indeed, the copper price jumped by 4% when Freeport declared force majeure at Grasberg, on September 24th. Even so, this year’s accidents are not enough to tip the

world into deficit. Their combined effects are easily absorbed by the industry’s typical “disruption allowance”. And that is before accounting for Chile’s Escondida mine, the world’s largest, which is producing unexpectedly large amounts.

That leaves economic policy as the only credible explanation for the price surge. Mr Trump’s trade barbs have warped copper markets. In July, having toyed with the idea for months, America set a 50% tariff on imports of the metal. Copper prices, which had since January been rising far more rapidly in New York than in London, jumped even higher on the news, hitting records on the American bourse. They fell in August, when Mr Trump exempted refined copper from the duties, but are rising again, amid speculation about new tariffs. The arbitrage opportunity has caused an exodus of stock to New York (see chart). Some 340,000 tonnes are now stranded in the city, up from 80,000 in January.

Such distortions are mostly neutral for copper prices in London, which are the global benchmark. A moderation in America’s economy has led the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, and the dollar has fallen this year. That makes commodities, priced in dollars and bearing no yield, more attractive to big, generalist investment funds, which have swarmed the copper market since 2020.

The influx of “tourist” buyers, for whom copper is only a tiny chunk of diverse portfolios, appear to pay little attention to the nitty-gritty of supply and demand. Their obsession with interest rates makes metal prices stickier. Yet at some point gravity may assert itself. Macro funds may lose their poise if, say, China’s economic slump worsens or triple-digit tariffs cause copper demand to crash. The metal’s big party could end with a fearsome hangover. ■
