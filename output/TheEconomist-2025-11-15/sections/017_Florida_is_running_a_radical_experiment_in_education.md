LAST MONTH’S Homecoming had a socially enforced uniform: the boys wore suits, the girls sequinned dresses and heels they couldn’t walk in. Pop anthems like “Pink Pony Club” and “California Gurls” played as 600 teenagers bounced in unison. By midnight a king and queen were crowned. It had all the trappings of an American high-school ritual, but none of these children attended an actual school. In Tampa, an old southern city with the restless energy of a Florida boomtown, a radical experiment in education is taking place. Parents empowered with $8,000 state vouchers to school their children as they see fit are fuelling a new kind of educational marketplace. It blends traditional

homeschooling, charter schools and new hyper-specialised “microschools” or “co-ops” that offer unbundled classes on everything from algebra and forestry to karate. The dressing-up ball for untraditional high-schoolers was hosted by one of more than a thousand organisations in the city that help parents curate an à la carte education for their children.

In Hillsborough County, where Tampa sits, at least one in every 15 children is homeschooled—more than anywhere else in the state. The typical Florida homeschooler is no longer a mother teaching her children at the kitchen table all alone. Instead, parents now act as general contractors, selecting their children’ schooling from a wide range of suppliers and shuttling them between lessons and extra-curricular classes. Many of these pupils have learning disabilities that make conventional school hard. But what is happening in Tampa is much broader. This year the county’s public schools lost 7,000 pupils to “deschooling”, as well as to more familiar charter, magnet and private schools.

During the pandemic fed-up parents across America dabbled in homeschooling. But when schools reopened, most sent their children back. In Florida, they didn’t. By a conservative estimate, in five years the number of homeschooled pupils jumped by 47%, to 155,000. The surge is a result of statewide policy. In March 2023 lawmakers passed one of America’s most expansive school-choice programmes. The cash it provides to subsidise parental choice is available regardless of a family’s income.

At Urban Cottage, an unusually good microschool in a gentrifying part of Tampa, pupils drop in for Montessori classes. For a few hours a day they learn to read with phonics, to write in cursive and to add and subtract with wooden bead frames. Teachers drift between the small rooms of the renovated house, where pupils label maps of South America and discuss the importance of the Magna Carta. “The only moms working here have advanced degrees in their fields,” says Marissa Hess, a former public-school teacher who runs it.

Other options are wackier. At Tampa Covenant, a co-op run in a church, families choose from a menu of lessons and clubs for young pupils, including one called “Before Personal Finance” and another on Dungeons & Dragons, a fantasy game. Outside the city, farm schools teach children to

tend cattle. Most families mix courses with home study—the Good and the Beautiful, a Mormon curriculum, is a popular one. Many parents are seeking more family time, play and fresh air. A pair of philosophy professors chose homeschooling because they believe they can spark a deeper love of learning than a teacher in an overcrowded classroom.

The unbundling of education is shaking up the school system. Conventional schools want to join in. Private ones now offer “homeschooling days”, where pupils can come in one day a week. Public schools allow families to pay to enroll in individual courses like statistics, or play on the football team. “We haven’t had to market our traditional schools in the past and now we have to,” says Howard Hepburn, the superintendent of Broward County public schools, Florida’s second-biggest district.

Education researchers worry about these changes, especially as other states with similar politics look to Florida as the schooling frontier. They reckon some of the rules are far too lax. On a Facebook group for parents navigating the state subsidy system, anonymous users trade tips on getting Netflix subscriptions, Disney World passes and home-gyms reimbursed as “educational materials”.

That might be less concerning if it were clear pupils were mastering the basics. While most states (but not Florida) require homeschoolers to teach core subjects like math, reading, and history, in practice they don’t enforce it, says Angela Watson of Johns Hopkins University.

Test-score data should make clear who is learning critical skills and who is not. But homeschoolers’ exam results are rarely, if ever, published. “I don’t see why we should be using public funds to pay for an education that lacks real quality control,” says Jon Valant of the Brookings Institution, a think- tank. Sheela VanHoose, an education lobbyist in Tallahassee, reckons that there is “going to have to be a fix bill” to fill some of Florida’s gaps.

Ms Hess says stricter rules won’t help. She opened Urban Cottage because she saw children slipping in schools and was fed up with how little freedom teachers had to be creative. “The American public school is the most regulated institution in America, and over the past 30 years it failed us,” she says. Today, nearly half the country’s pupils are below grade level. She

believes unbridled capitalism is the best remedy—and that if it works in Florida, the rest of America will follow. ■
